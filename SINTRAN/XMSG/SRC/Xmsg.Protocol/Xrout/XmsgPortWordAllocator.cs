    /// A port field in the XMSG sub-header is the low word of a 32-bit magic number:
    /// <c>(port number shifted left 7) | random</c>. The port number is the allocating node's own
    /// port-table index, one-based; the random part is a draw from <see cref="XmsgRandomGenerator"/>
    /// and is what stops a reopened port reusing its old identifier.
    /// <para><b>Why a peer must never compute one</b></para>
    /// This is deliberately an allocator for OUR OWN ports, never a way to predict a peer's. The
    /// spec's rule stands: every non-zero port is an opaque learned value - the asker port comes
    /// from the connect frame, the server port from the accept, the terminal port from the
    /// port-assign. A responder may answer on any well-formed port word it likes, which is exactly
    /// why deriving one from the other side's fields is both unnecessary and wrong.
    /// <para><b>Fidelity, not compatibility</b></para>
    /// Using this changes nothing a peer can object to - it only makes our port words look like
    /// the ones a real kernel mints, drawn from the real generator in the real order. A fixed
    /// port word works just as well on the wire and has been verified live.
