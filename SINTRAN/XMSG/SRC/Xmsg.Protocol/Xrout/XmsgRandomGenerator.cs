    /// Despite what the manual implies by calling a reopened port's identifier "extremely
    /// unlikely" to repeat, ZRAND is a plain 16-bit linear congruential generator carved from the
    /// XMSG L03 kernel at 131152 octal:
    /// <code>
    /// seed := seed * 5429 + 13849   (mod 65536)      ; octal 012465 and 033031
    /// draw := seed AND 127                            ; SAT 127 + RAND ST DA
    /// redraw while draw = 0 or draw = 127             ; JAZ + SKP IF DA UEQ ST
    /// </code>
    /// The increment is odd and the multiplier minus one is divisible by four, so by the
    /// Hull-Dobell theorem the generator has full period 65536 - and the low seven bits are
    /// themselves a full-period generator modulo 128, <c>r' = (53 * r + 25) mod 128</c>, which
    /// cycles through every one of the 128 values before repeating.
    /// <para><b>What that buys a decoder</b></para>
    /// Because the low seven bits of a magic number are these draws, and the wire port fields are
    /// the magic number's low word, successive port allocations on a node walk a known 128-long
    /// cycle. One observed port word therefore predicts every later one, and a value's position in
    /// the cycle is that node's allocation ordinal since XMSG started. This was confirmed against
    /// the capture corpus: 24 distinct draws taken from 753 wire endpoint fields all lie on the
    /// cycle, in runs of up to ten consecutive outputs, with no value ever 0 or 127.
