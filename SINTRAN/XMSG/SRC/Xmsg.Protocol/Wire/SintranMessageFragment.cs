    ///  - The same transfer of a 167-byte file - a sixth of one block - which still ships whole
    ///    pages and still splits at 594.
    ///  - The file-access <c>ReadFile</c> delivery, message length 1032, over Ethernet:
    ///    <c>2113 000A ... 0408</c> then <c>2113 000C ... 0252</c>, which is 1032 total and a
    ///    continuation resuming at 594.
