    /// <remarks>
    /// The shape of a line is "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff | message". The pipe with a space on each
    /// side is a plain, easy-to-split marker: split on the first " | " and you have the time and
    /// the message, with no guessing, even when the message itself holds a bare '|'.
    ///
    /// WHY THIS CLASS EXISTS TWICE
    ///  - The live runner (SRC/Xmsg.Live.Runner/Program.cs) has the same class, and the format here
    ///    is copied from it CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER on purpose, so a hub log and a runner log can be
    ///    read side by side and lined up by time.
    ///  - It is copied rather than shared because the hub project has no project references at all.
    ///    That is a deliberate choice written down in Xmsg.Hub.csproj: the hub is the wire between
    ///    machines and stays free of the XMSG stack. Pulling in the whole live library just to get
    ///    forty lines of writer would throw that away. If a small shared logging package ever
    ///    appears, both copies should move into it.
    ///  - If you change the format here, change it in the runner too, or the two logs stop lining up.
    ///
    /// A note on threads: the hub writes log lines from several connection threads. Console.SetOut
    /// and Console.SetError wrap whatever they are given in a synchronised writer, so only one
    /// thread is inside Write at a time and the "am I at the start of a line" flag stays honest.
