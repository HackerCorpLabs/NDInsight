    /// Per the manual (section 1.2.3 and appendix A section 3.1) a magic number is composed of the
    /// port number, the system number and a random part; the random part makes it extremely
    /// unlikely that a port which is closed and reopened gets the same identifier. The manual
    /// never publishes HOW the three are packed - it exposes conversion functions instead - so the
    /// packing below was carved from the XMSG L03 kernel (routines ZCRMG, ZRAND and MFM2P) and is
    /// documented with the disassembly in DOC/XMSG-MAGIC-NUMBER-LAYOUT-CARVED-2026-07-26.md.

    /// number in the high word; the random part is masked to seven bits, so a reopened port
    /// collides with its former identifier once in 128 times.
    /// <para><b>Prefer the kernel functions anyway</b></para>
