    /// The whole point of XROUT is that it never hands a caller somebody else's magic number
    /// (section 1.3). This class keeps that property: <see cref="SendLetter"/> takes a NAME and
    /// delivers the letter into the named port's kernel with the sender's magic number attached.
    /// The caller gets a status, never an address. The server then learns who wrote to it the way
    /// the manual says - by asking its own kernel about the arrived message - and decides whether
    /// to answer.
    /// <para><b>Named ports and connection ports</b></para>
    /// <see cref="RegisterName"/> is XSNAM: one name, one port, and a second registration of the
    /// same name is refused. <see cref="RegisterConnectionPort"/> is XSCRS: it adds a
    /// free-connection counter, forwards a letter only while that counter is above zero, and
    /// decrements it on each forward. <see cref="AdjustFreeConnections"/> is XSNSP, which is how a
    /// server gives capacity back when a session ends.
    /// <para><b>Scope</b></para>
    /// This is the local half of XROUT - enough to build and test servers and clients against.
    /// Routing a letter to another SYSTEM is the node layer's job and is not modelled here; a
