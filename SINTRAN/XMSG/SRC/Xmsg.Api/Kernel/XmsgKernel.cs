    /// The manual is explicit that a SYSTEM is "a processing unit that runs an independent XMSG
    /// kernel" (section 1.2.2), and that tasks in the same system exchange messages through it. So
    /// one instance of this class serves every task on one system; each task simply owns the ports
    /// it opened. Two instances are two SYSTEMS and cannot deliver to each other locally - traffic
    /// between them goes through <see cref="IXmsgDatagramSink"/>, exactly as it would on the wire.
    /// <para><b>What is real here</b></para>
    /// Everything the manual specifies about a task's own view of XMSG - the port list and its
    /// default-port rule, the buffer pool, task-current and port-current messages, the per-port
    /// queue with high-priority insertion, secure messages coming back when they cannot be
    /// delivered, and the exact status each function returns. Two tasks that share a kernel talk to
    /// each other end to end, which is what the manual calls the same-system case: the send
    /// TRANSFERS the buffer rather than copying it.
    /// <para><b>What is delegated</b></para>
    /// A send to another system goes to <see cref="IXmsgDatagramSink"/>. Nothing in this class
    /// touches an envelope, a Counter, a channel byte or a link sequence - that belongs to the node

    /// Waiting is not modelled: options that would suspend the task (XFWTF) are accepted and
    /// treated as a poll, because there is no scheduler here to suspend. Calls report
