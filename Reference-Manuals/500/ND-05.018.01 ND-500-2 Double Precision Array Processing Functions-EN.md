# Preface

## THE PRODUCT

This manual describes the mathematical functions in the ND-500/2-APD library.

The APD library routines may be called from FORTRAN. The routines are designed to speed up the execution of operations on double precision real arrays.

The APD library utilizes a special microprogram for the ND-500/2 CPU. The special double precision functions within this microprogram are called ND-500/2 DAX functions. This microprogram is an extension of the CXA microprogram.

The ND-numbers for the product on the different ND-500/2 models are:

| Computer         | ND-number | Microprogram version |
|------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| ND-550/2         | ND-10786  | 152xx                |
| ND-560/2         | ND-10786  | 152xx                |
| ND-570/2 (new CX)| ND-10786  | 152xx                |
| ND-570/2 (old CXA)| ND-10786 | 152xx                |

**NOTE** The ND-530/2 can not use this product.

## THE MANUAL

This manual provides a functional description of the APD library, and thereby the ND-500/2 DAX functions. A listing of each routine is used to describe the routines. Listing and parameter description is done in FORTRAN.

## THE READER

This manual is written for people creating and running programs using array processing functions.

# ND-500/2 DOUBLE PRECISION ARRAY PROCESSING FUNCTIONS

## 1 BASIC CONCEPTS

### 1.1 PREREQUISITE SOFTWARE FOR USING THE APD LIBRARY

Together with the microprogram, the APD library must be installed. The actual file name is: ND-500-2-APD:NRF.

These are the only modifications to be performed on the system.

The APD library utilizes a special microprogram for the ND-500/2 CPU. This microprogram contains the double precision array processing functions. It is an extension of the ND-500/2 CXA microprogram.

The ND-500/2 DAX functions are floating point operations performed in 64 bits floating point format by the ND-500/2 floating point arithmetic.

### 1.2 THE DOUBLE PRECISION FLOATING POINT FORMAT

The number range for the double precision floating point format is:

|        |    |
|--------|----|
| 8.6 * 10^-78 | ≤ | |N| | ≤ | 5.8 * 10^76 |

The accuracy corresponds approximately to 16 decimal digits.

### 1.3 HARDWARE CONCEPTS

The ND-500 CPU gives possibility of parallel processing. This means that indexing, memory access, floating point arithmetic, integer arithmetic and loop control may be run in parallel. This is done as far as possible to obtain high speed operations. Temporary results to be used in later calculations, are kept in registers in the ND-500/2 CPU, accessed directly by both the floating point arithmetic and integer arithmetic. In this way unnecessary memory accesses are avoided.

Arrays involved in an operation are accessed through the ND-500/2 memory management system. This system will automatically cause allocation of memory and reservation of continuous memory space for array processing is not required. The result of an array processing function is present in output array when returning from the function.

The ND-500/2 DAX functions are fully interruptable to maintain the ND-500/2 CPU resources being shared by the different processes currently running on the system.

# 1.4 Array Processing Definitions

An array contains a group of numbers that are related to each other in some way, and the array may be multi-dimensional. An array is termed a matrix in mathematical terminology.

An array is used to represent equations of different kinds, for example, linear equations. Each row in the array represents one particular equation, thus the array represents a system of equations of the same kind.

The entries in the array are the coefficients of the equations. They are called elements in this manual.

Each row of elements is named a vector in this manual, regardless of what kind of equation it mathematically represents. In those array processing functions which are closely related to mathematical vectors, the row of elements is referred to as a complex vector.

Most of the DAX functions are performed on one-dimensional vectors.

## Example of Equations:

| Mathematical equations:   | Arrays:         |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| \(2x + 8y + 5z = 24\)     | \[2 \ 8 \ 5 \ 24\]  |
| \(3x + 2y + 1z = 0\)      | \[3 \ 2 \ 1 \ 0\]   |
| \(11x + 0y + 5z = 4\)     | \[11 \ 0 \ 5 \ 4\]  |
|                           |                 |
| \(2x^2 + y = 3\)          | \[2 \ 1 \ 3\]       |
| \(x^2 + y = 0\)           | \[1 \ 1 \ 0\]       |

# ND-500/2 DOUBLE PRECISION ARRAY PROCESSING FUNCTIONS
## BASIC CONCEPTS

Three parameters are necessary to specify a vector:

- **V** - The logical name of the vector. A double precision real.
- **INC** - The step value (increment) for the index in the array. An integer.
- **NN** - Element count. Number of elements in the array. An integer.

> **NOTE** It is assumed that the lower limit for the array index is 1!

### Example of Use of a DAX Function

    PROGRAM CLEAR

    DOUBLE PRECISION VA(2000); % Remember to declare the vector as double precision real.
    INTEGER INCA,NN;
    
    <Other program statements>

    INCA = 2
    NN = 1000
    
    CALL VCLR(VA,INCA,NN)
    
    <Other program statements>

    END

This DAX function causes each second element of the vector VA to be set to zero (increment is 2).

---

For vectors where the elements are stored in consecutive locations, the index increment is equal to 1. The flexibility to specify index increments is present to most of the functions.

For complex vectors, each complex equation is represented by two consecutive elements. This corresponds to the real and the imaginary part of the complex vector. The real element is immediately followed by the imaginary element, as the complex vector is represented in the rectangular coordinate system.

This means that for **each** index in the array there are one real and one imaginary element.

## Page 16

# Example of Use of a Complex DAX Function

```
PROGRAM CVMULTIPLY

COMPLEX*16 VA(1:200)
COMPLEX*16 VB(1:200)
COMPLEX*16 VC(1:200)

{Other program statements}

CALL CVMUL(VA,1,VB,2,VC,1,100,1)

{Other program statements}

END
```

This DAX function causes each complex vector of the array VA to be multiplied with each second vector from VB. The results are stored in array VC. This function corresponds to mathematical multiplication of complex numbers.

# ND-500/2 DOUBLE PRECISION ARRAY PROCESSING FUNCTIONS USING THE ND-500/2 DAX FUNCTIONS

## 2 USING THE ND-500/2 DAX FUNCTIONS

The ND-500/2 DAX functions can be called from FORTRAN. The array processing library is used to transfer the parameters from the call to the array processing instructions. Thus the array processing functions are connected to the main program at load time as a part of the program.

Writing a FORTRAN program for array processing with ND-500/2 DAX functions is much the same as using the FORTRAN equivalent for the array processing function. Before starting an array processing function, input and output arrays for the operations must be defined. Initialization of input arrays is also required. This means that data for processing must be placed in the input arrays for the actual array processing function. Then the array processing function may be called. The result of the operation is present in the output array when returning from an array processing function.

## Example of Creating a FORTRAN Program Using DAX Functions

### Source Program in FORTRAN:

    PROGRAM DOKKT
    C Set name and size of arrays to be used.
    PARAMETER NN = 100; NC = 20
    IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION (A-H,O-Z)
    DIMENSION VA(NN),VB(NN),VC(NN),VL(NC)
    INTEGER*4 I I(NC)
    C Initiate scalar values, index increment and element count
    C for the VRAMP function.
    DELTA = 1.0D+01
    SC1 = 1.5
    SC2 = 2.0D-01
    INC1 = 1
    INC2 = 2
    INC4 = 4
    C Initiate VA with a ramp.
    CALL VRAMP(SC1,SC2,VA,INC1,NN)
    C Clear result array to be used in next operation.
    CALL VCLR(VC,INC1,NN)
    NB = NN/2
    DO 100 M=1,NB
      CALL SVE(VA(M),INC1,VC(M),NB)
    100 CONTINUE
    C Set scalar value.
    B = 200.0
    C 200.0 divided with each second element of VA.
    C Result in VB.

## ND-500/2 DAX FUNCTIONS PERFORMANCE

The next table shows how the ND-500/2 DAX functions may be used to improve the performance even on small arrays. With high cache hit ratio, an improvement ratio of 4.4 can be obtained with the VADD function, while low cache hit ratio will reduce the improvement ratio over FORTRAN.

## 4 ARRAY PROCESSING FUNCTIONS

### 4.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter contains a listing of each array processing function to describe the different functions. For each routine the required parameter list for calling the array processing function is included together with definitions.

The ND-500/2 double precision array processing functions are implemented as one instruction.

The different functions are using the same instruction code. The contents of the record register are the only difference between the functions and are used to distinguish between them.

For each routine, an identification number is given as a cross reference between the object code and the array processing function. This identification number is given as two octal numbers:   
'Ident (R:I) : xxx:nnnnnB8'. 'xxx' are the contents of the record register. 'nnnnn' is the instruction code used for the DAX function.

The library for the ND-500 double precision array processing functions consists of one routine for each of the array processing functions. Each routine is building a data stack depending on the called array processing function. The data stack is used by the array processing functions to find addresses of input and output arrays, scalar values or addresses, index increments and element count.

# 4.34 Complex Vector Multiply (CVMUL)

## Format

CVMUL(VA,INCA,VB,INCB,VC,INCC,NN,NE) Ident (R:I) : 040:177515B

## Explanation

Multiply two complex vectors. This function corresponds to mathematical multiplication of complex numbers. An own flag selects whether the result should be conjugated or not. VA = VAr + VAi, VB = VBr + VBi.

If the conjugate flag ≥ 0 then:

VC = (VAr * VBr - VAi*VBi)r + (VAr*VBi + VAi*VBr)i, else:

VC = (VAr * VBr - VAi*VBi)r - (VAr*VBi + VAi*VBr)i.

'r' and 'i' denotes real and imaginary elements.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description                        |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| VA        | Name of input vector VA.           |

# 4.35 VECTOR TAPER (VTAPER)

## Format

VTAPER(VA,VC,NN,IFLAG) Ident (R:I) : 041:177515B

## Explanation

Multiply each element of a vector with an increasing or decreasing factor. An own flag selects either the decreasing or the increasing factor. The factor is a function of the element count.

If flag > 0 then:

\[ VC_1 = VA_1 * (1/nn) \]  
\[ VC_2 = VA_2 * (2/nn) \]  
\[ \ldots \]  
\[ VCnn = VAnn * (1) \]

So the general element equation is:  
\[ VCn = VAn * (n/nn) \]

If flag ≤ 0 then:

\[ VC_1 = VA_1 * (1 - 1/nn) \]  
\[ VC_2 = VA_2 * (1 - 2/nn) \]  
\[ \ldots \]  
\[ VCnn = VAnn * (0) \]

So the general element equation is:  
\[ VCn = VAn * (1 - n/nn) \]

'nn' denotes the element count and 'n' the element index.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description               |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| VA        | Name of input vector VA.  |
| VC        | Name of output vector VC. |
| NN        | Element count.            |
| IFLAG     | Flag.                     |

## 4.36 VECTOR RAMP FUNCTION (VRAMP)

### Format

VRAMP(SCALAR, SCINC, VC, INCC, NN) Ident (R:I) : 043:177515B

### Explanation

Form a vector as a ramp function with a start value and a slope as input parameters.

\[ VC_1 = sc + scinc, \ VC_2 = sc + 2 \times scinc \ .. \ VC_{nn} = sc + nn \times scinc. \]

So the general element expression is: VCn = sc + n \* scinc.

'nn' denotes the element count, 'n' the element index, 'sc' start value, and 'scinc' slope.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| SCALAR    | Scalar for start value.     |
| SCINC     | Scalar for increment.       |
| VC        | Name of output vector VC.   |
| INCC      | VC index increment.         |
| NN        | Element count.              |
