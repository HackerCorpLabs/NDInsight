# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION  
## HARDWARE DESCRIPTION  

### 1 HARDWARE DESCRIPTION  

#### 1.1 GENERAL  

This chapter describes the TWIN 16-BIT PORT module, the DYNAMIC RAM module and the LINE DRIVER module in the Multiport 5 Memory Systems, from a hardware point of view. Chapter 2 contains a programming guide for the MPM-5 Test and Maintenance Program, from which all initialization and testing of the modules are made. The program is operated from the console terminal which is connected to the maintenance processor on the controller module.  

#### 1.2 THE TWIN 16-BIT PORT  

The memory port module is called a 'twin 16-bit port' because it is 2 x 16 bits wide and can be connected to both 16-bit and 32-bit width data channels. The module accepts one address cable with up to 29 address bits (addressing 32-bit words). Interface specifications are given in the Multiport Memory Channel Specifications manual (ND 10.006).  

Two versions of the twin port module have been made, one with printed circuit board (PCB) number 5152 and the other with PCB number 5155. The difference between the two versions lies in the address handling.  

The module is divided into two parts, described here as the ADDRESS part and the DATA part. The block diagram in Fig. 1 gives an overview of the organization of the module.

### 1.3 DATA PART

The port module accepts two data cables of 16 bits each (+ 2 parity bits each). During a memory write operation, the 16 (18) or 32 (36) bits received are latched into a write buffer. The DATA READY signal is generated instantly, and sent back to the requesting source.

ND-10.004.01

## Page 19

# MULTIPORT MEMORY TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

## HARDWARE DESCRIPTION

During a memory read operation, 32 bits are read from memory. 16 bits (+ 2 parity bits) are forwarded to the 16-bit sources. The ND-500 gets 32 (+ 4) bits at a time from the twin port module.

### 1.4 ADDRESS PART

When the source looks at the memory, it sees the total memory range of the system. The address seen from the source is called the channel address. The bank, however, has its own local address range. A conversion from channel address to physical bank address is then needed.

When 16-bit and 32-bit sources are to communicate, the 16-bit data words have to be stored as 32-bit words which can be read directly to the 32-bit sources. The interleave technique is used to manage this problem.

The differences between the two versions, 5152 and 5155, of the twin 16-bit port module are the address-window handling and the interleave possibilities. The address-window handling for the 5152 is described on page 8, and the interleave for the 5152 is described on page 13. The address-window handling for the 5155 is described on page 9, and the interleave for the 5155 is described on page 11.

The flowchart in Fig. 2 illustrates how the address handling in general is sequenced on the port module.

### 1.4.1 Address Windows

The address windows are used to test if the channel address is within the address range of the port. A memory port is assigned its own address range within the total range of the memory system. The addresses specified define the address range that the source sees in a memory bank. This is done by setting a lower and an upper address limit on the port with the test and maintenance program on the controller module.

The address limits define one or more address windows in the memory area of the bank. How you program the desired limits is described in Chapter 2. An illustration of how the address windows appear in the memory is shown in Fig. 3.

*Fig. 3. Address Windows within Memory*

When an address is received by the port from the memory channel, the port tests the address against its address windows. The port will respond only if the channel address is within the address range of the port. An illustration of this is given in Fig. 4.

*Fig. 4. Port Response to Channel Address*

The way the address windows are decoded differs somewhat between the two versions 5152 and 5155. This is explained in section 1.4.2 and section 1.4.3.

### 1.4.2 Address Windows Decoding on the 5152

Four 4 Kbit RAMs are used to decode the address windows. The windows are contained in a look-up table giving a resolution in memory of 128 Kbyte. By keeping the addresses in a memory, it is possible to implement holes within the memory area.

Bits 17-28 in the channel address are used to find the right bit in the RAMs. Bit 29 and 30 select which of the 4 RAMs shall be used. The right RAM will respond with a '1' if the channel address is within the windows. Bit 31 in the address is not present on the channel, and therefore not decoded.

The RAMs have stand-by power, and do not need to be initiated after a power fail if the stand-by power has been on all the time.

ND–10.004.01

## Page 23

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
## HARDWARE DESCRIPTION

The 16-bit data that is written into the RAMs is decoded as a 12-bit address, and a 4-bit data word. Bits 0, 13, 14, and 15 are data, and bits 1-12 are address. The address bits correspond to bits 17-28 in the 32-bit address. The four RAMs may be seen as a 16 K 1 bit memory, where each address on the channel corresponds to one bit under decoding. When the RAMs are loaded, 4 bits are written each time, with address separation 10000 octal seen from the channel. This means that when bits 1-12 (of the 16-bit data word) are all zero, bit 13 will be the content of location 0 in the 16 K 1 bit memory, bit 14 location 10000 octal, bit 15 location 20000 octal and bit 0 location 40000 octal. Example:

    Lower limit = 00 004 000 000
    Upper limit = 00 010 000 000

This means that locations 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 15, 16, 17 and 20 (in the 16 K 1 bit memory) shall have content '1'. All other locations are set to '0'. When the RAMs are loaded, the 16 data bits must be:

| access no. | location to be loaded | contents of 16-bit data word |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
|            | (module 10000 octal)  |                             |

### 1.4.3 Address Windows Decoding on the 5155

On the 5155, two 16 K x 1 bit RAMs are used to decode the address limits. One RAM is used for decoding of LOCAL access, ie., within the MPM-5 bank, and the other RAM is used for decoding of GLOBAL access, ie., through a line driver module to other banks.

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
## HARDWARE DESCRIPTION

The address windows are contained in a look-up table giving a resolution in memory of 128 Kbyte. The resolution used when the port acts as a 16-bit data port is 64 Kbyte, because this is the address resolution when using 16-bit words. The LOCAL and/or GLOBAL accesses are defined in the address windows look-up table.

By keeping the addresses in a look-up table it is possible to implement holes inside the windows. Fig. 5 illustrates how the look-up table is organized.

Totally 16 K one-bit locations, each representing one address location in memory.

When 16-bit words are used in memory, the resolution is 64 Kbyte.

When 32-bit words are used in memory, the resolution is 128 Kbyte.

Bits 17-30 in the channel address are used to find the right bits in the RAMs. The RAMs will respond with a '1' if the channel address is within the address windows. Bit 31 in the address is not present, and therefore not decoded.

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

## HARDWARE DESCRIPTION

The 16-bit data that is written into the RAMs is decoded as a 14-bit address and a 2-bit data word. Bit 0 and bit 15 are data, and bits 1-14 are address. The address bits correspond to bits 17-30 in the 32-bit channel address. The RAMs may be seen as two 16 K 1-bit memories, where each address on the channel corresponds to one bit under decoding. When the RAMs are loaded, 2 bits are written each time.

### 1.4.4 Address Conversion

The **base** is essential in the address conversion. A bank has its own internal physical memory range. To convert the channel address into bank address, a base register is added to the channel address. It is the upper 16 bits of the channel address that will be justified.

It is important to distinguish between the base and the base register. The base is the start address, which means the first physical address in the bank, and it has an increment of 128 Kbyte. When programming the port, the start address is the parameter that has to be used. But the value which is placed in the base register by the program, is 2's complement of the base subtracted from lower limit. Example:

|                |                |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Lower limit** | 00 004 000 000 |
| **Base**        | 00 000 400 000 |

use only 16 bits means

|                |        |
|----------------|--------|
| **Lower limit** | 000020 |
| **Base**        | 000002 |

|                         |        |
|-------------------------|--------|
| **Lower limit - base** | 000016 |

2's complement of 000016 gives

**Value of the base register = 377762**

### 1.4.5 Interleave

The purpose of the interleave is to site subsequent channel addresses in different hardware parts. This makes the bandwidth increase, because a new request can be issued before the preceding one is served. It also enables for wide-channel (more than 16 bits) communication, because the whole width can be read at a time.

ND-10.004.01

## Page 26

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
## HARDWARE DESCRIPTION

The interleave is performed by shifting the channel address bits a number of positions to the right. The bits shifted are compared to registers at the port module. The channel address locations are directed to separate hardware parts, depending on the value of the shifted address bits. There are several interleave types, with a different number of address bits shifted, as shown in Fig. 6.

| Interleave type: | Address bits shifted:          |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0 way            | (not shifted)                 |
| 2 way            | one position to the right     |
| 4 way            | two positions to the right    |
| 8 way            | three positions to the right  |

*Fig. 6. Interleave Types*

If we consider two-way interleave, the interleave function has to work so that subsequent addresses enter alternating ports. When one address is let through in port 0, the next address is let through in port 1, the subsequent address in port 0, and so on. When the address has been accepted by the port, the port has to decide in which half of the 32-bit memory the 16-bit word is to be placed. This is done by checking the least significant bit in the address. Odd addresses are placed in one part, even addresses in the other. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.

```

The interleave organization depends upon the computer system configuration. In an ND-570 system with a 64-bit wide cache memory and with the twin-port version 5152, the standard interleave PROM on the 5152 has to be replaced by a special interleave PROM. The PROM has position 2111 on the printed circuit board.

In an ND-570 system with a 32-bit wide cache memory, and in all other systems with the 5152 version, the standard interleave prom is kept.

Systems may also have the twin-port version 5155 instead of the 5152 version. The 5155 has a special ALLOW bit in the master control register, which is described in page 16. With this bit it is possible to change from 32-bit interleave (ND-570 with 64-bit wide cache) to 16-bit interleave (all other systems). It is then not necessary to change the interleave PROM.

## 1.5 Control and Test Registers

The port has several registers that may be programmed from the MP-bus controller, or from another device that generates control signals for I/O functions on the MP-bus. The registers are used in control and test procedures and can be divided into two groups, one used in WRITE operations and the other in READ operations on the MP-bus. The registers are as follows:

## Page 30

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
## HARDWARE DESCRIPTION

A more detailed description of the registers is given in section 1.5.1 through section 1.5.6.

### 1.5.1 Test Request

A write access on this address starts a request to the MP-bus from the port. The address on the MP-bus is the one that is put into the test address register. The cycle will be a read/write cycle, and the write data is taken from the test data register. Read data is placed in the same register. Only one test request will be executed after access on this address.

**NOTE:** The test bit (bit 3) in the master control register must be set to '1' before the desired test request, otherwise the request will not be executed.

### 1.5.2 Master Control Register

The bits of the master control register have the following meaning:

| Bit | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 0   | If = '0', inhibits all requests from the port on the MP-bus. If the request is coming from the channel, no address ready or data ready signals will be returned. |
| 1   | If = '1', super test is performed. |
| 2   | If = '1', disables address bits 24 through 28, i.e., the address bits not supplied by old ND equipment. |
| 3   | Test, - must be set before a desired test request and before loading the address windows. When normal operation is wanted, the test bit must be set to '0'. |
| 4   | This bit has different functions on 5152 and on 5155. |

On 5152: Local bit under request, '1' indicates if local access is wanted. At least one of the bits 4 and 5 must be set to '1'.

On 5155: ALLOW bit. When = '1', it allows for access from an ND-500 with a 32-bit wide cache memory. When it = '0' it allows for access from an ND-500 with a 64-bit wide cache memory.

5 This bit is not used on 5155. On 5152: Global bit under request, '1' indicates if global access is wanted.

6 Inverted write parity check, '1' means no parity check on write.

7 Not used.

### 1.5.3 Port Control Register

The bits of the port control register have the following meaning:

| Bit | Description                                    |
|-----|------------------------------------------------|
| 0   | Interleave type bit 0.                         |
| 1   | Interleave type bit 1.                         |
| 2   | Bank number if interleave, bit 0.              |
| 3   | Bank number if interleave, bit 1.              |
| 4   | Speed-up bit 0.                                |
| 5   | Speed-up bit 1.                                |
| 6   | If = '1', 32-bit (ND-500) data channel. If = '0', 16-bit (ND-100) data channel. |
| 7   | Wait, disable write queue (buffered write).    |

Bits 0 and 1 generate the desired interleave type. The effect of the bit settings is shown in the table in Fig. 9, which is the same figure as Fig. 8.

Bits 4 and 5 are called 'speed-up'. They may be used if the addresses from the channel sources are stable before request is sent. The table in Fig. 11 shows the effect of the different speed-up bit settings.

# Multiport Memory 5 Technical Description

## Hardware Description

Bit 6 must be '0' when a 32-bit channel is connected and '1' when a 16-bit channel is connected.

Bit 7 is called 'wait', and must be used if the channel source makes a pulsed request (which is not found on ND equipment). With the wait bit set, the channel waits until the port has access to the MP-bus during a write cycle. This is not necessary if the request is turned off after an address ready.

### 1.5.4 Test Address

The address used during a test request may be written into the test address register. The address has a length of 32 bits, and is read from the MP-bus controller. It must be written in two steps, 16 bits each time.

### 1.5.5 Test Data

The write data that has to be used during the test request must be placed in this register before the request. After a test request a 32-bit word can be read out. The test request is a read/write cycle.

### 1.5.6 Base

The base for calculating the physical bank address on the MP-bus must be placed in this register.

### 1.5.7 Address Windows

**For 5152:** Four 4 Kbit RAMs are used in decoding the address windows. 16-bit data is written into the RAMs, and decoded as a 12-bit address and a 4-bit data word. The four RAMs may be considered as a 16K x 1 bit memory, where each address on the channel corresponds to one bit in the memory.

**For 5155:** Two 16 K x 1 bit RAMs are used in decoding the limits, one for global access and the other for local access. Each channel address corresponds to one bit in memory.

### 1.5.8 Display

The display register is used to load 16 different 7-segment displays at the card edge. All 16 displays are loaded with the same address. In the necessary 8-bit data word, bits 0 - 3 describe the value to

The displays are listed in the table in Fig. 12.

### 1.5.12 Test Data

The 32-bit test data is read on both addresses.

# 1.6 The Dynamic RAM Module

The Dynamic RAM module (print number 5411) can be equipped to give 2 different models:

1) 1 Mbyte (4 rows with 64 K x 1 bit memory chips)

2) 4 Mbyte (4 rows with 256 K x 1 bit memory chips)

The module has 32-bit data width plus 7 correction bits. The correction code is a modified Hamming code, which is able to correct single errors and detect multiple errors. When errors occur, the maintenance processor updates an EEPROM (the error memory) on the memory module. The error memory is a non-volatile 2 K x 8-bit memory that contains a log of the errors occurring on the specific memory module.

The module accepts single bytes during a write operation. A read-modify-write cycle is then performed internally on the module, because the correction code is different when single bytes are written.

The memory range of the module is defined by a lower address limit and an upper address limit, which together give the size of the module. The lower address limit and the size of the module are supplied from the maintenance processor.

The start address, which is the lower address of the module, is programmed from the maintenance processor. The upper address is calculated by the module itself. The lower address and the size of the module are displayed on the card.

# 1.7 Dynamic RAM Registers

The dynamic RAM module has several registers which are programmed from the maintenance processor. The registers are as follows:

ND-10.004.01

---

## Page 39

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
## HARDWARE DESCRIPTION

- Slot Identification
- RAM Control
- Lower Limit
- Display Memory
- Error Memory Address
- Error Memory Data
- Suppress Error Table

### 1.7.1 Slot Identification

This register is used in read operations. The different bits have the following meaning:

| Bits  | Meaning              |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0 - 10  | Type and Model Code |
| 11 - 15 | Slot Code           |

### 1.7.2 RAM Control Register

This register determines the special modes in which the module can be operated. The different bits have the following meaning:

- **Bit 0 = '1'** means disable error correction.
  
- **Bit 0 = '0'** means enable error correction if manual disable switch is also turned off. Green LED is lighted.

- **Bit 1 = '1'** means enable suppression of error reporting. When suppression is active, previously detected single bit errors are not reported.

- **Bit 1 = '0'** means report all errors detected.

- **Bit 2 = '1'** means disable memory access to this module without

ND-10.004.01

## Page 40

# 1.7.3 Limit

This register contains the lower address limit of the module, and must be programmed according to the module size which is 1 Mbyte or 4 Mbyte. The different bits have the following meaning:

- **1 Mbyte:** Bits 0 - 3 = '0', Bits 4 - 15 = Limit in 1 Mbyte units.

- **4 Mbyte:** Bits 0 - 5 = '0', Bits 6 - 15 = Limit in 4 Mbyte units.

# 1.7.4 Display Memory

The display always shows the lower limit in 256 Kbyte units. The limit will therefore range from 0 to 37777, placed in the five rightmost digits of the display. The left digit shows the size of the module in 256 Kbyte units:

| Module Size   | Left Digit |
|---------------|------------|
| 1 Mbyte module| 4          |
| 4 Mbyte module| 6          |

The format of the display memory is as follows:

- **Bit 0 - 3:** Digit value, octal format is default, any format is possible.

**NOTE:** The value must be inverted before it is written out!

---

Bit 4 - 6: Digit number. The leftmost is number 0, the rightmost is number 5.

### 1.7.5 Error Memory Address

The address of the desired memory byte can be loaded into this register. Note that the register is reset to 0 after about 1 second, because the contents of the slot identification register have to be displayed as status information. The different bits have the following meaning:

Bits 0 - 10: Address bits.

| Bit | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| 11  | = '1' means write enable. Prepares the contents of the Error Memory Data register to be written into the chip. To do the actual transfer, a programming pulse must be sent separately from the universal timer of the maintenance processor. <br> = '0' means normal read operation. |

### 1.7.6 Error Memory Data

This data register contains the value to be written into the error memory.

Bits 0 - 8: One byte of data.

### 1.7.7 Suppress Error Table

This table is loaded with the errors detected by the error code. This means that a specific error is only reported the first time it is detected. This of course only concerns single-bit correctable errors. Fatal errors have to be reported each time (although it is possible to suppress them).

ND-10.004.01

## Page 42

# Multiport Memory 5 Technical Description
## Hardware Description

The different bits have the following meaning:

### Bits 0 - 6
Error code (syndrome code) 0-127 (decimal). The significance of the codes is listed on page 69.

### Bits 7 - 8
Section number showing for which of the four memory rows the error code is valid.

### Bit 9
When = '1': Suppress error messages from chip pointed out by bits 0 - 8.

When = '0': Report error messages in chip pointed out by bits 0 - 8.

## 2 PROGRAMMING GUIDE FOR THE MPM-5 SYSTEM

### 2.1 GENERAL

All the registers on the port module and the dynamic RAM module are programmed from the Multiport-5 Test and Maintenance Program. This program appears at the console terminal connected to the controller module.

The Test and Maintenance Program is always present at the console terminal. If the console is a CRT-terminal and the screen is empty, push the return key and the prompt `>` will appear. When you see the prompt `>`, you can give commands to the program.

The program has 22 different commands, which are explained in this chapter. The commands can be abbreviated in the same way as SINTRAN commands. The parameters can be separated by space or comma. If the commands are not followed by parameters, the parameters will be prompted.

| NOTE! The MPM-5 Test and Maintenance Program requires UPPER CASE position on the console terminal. |

Control characters can be used for command editing. They are as follows:

CTRL A: Delete one character.

CTRL C: Copy one character.

CTRL D: Copy rest of line including RETURN.

CTRL S: Stop print-out on screen (only XON/XOFF terminals)

CTRL Q: Start a new empty line where the old command can be edited

After CTRL S: Start print-out on screen (only on XON/XOFF terminals)

Parameter: Channel number

When this command is given, the interrupt from the specified channel number is disabled. The channel numbers are the same as for the ENABLE-INTERRUPT command, see Fig.14.

## 2.14 DUMP-ERROR-LOG

Parameter: Slot number

This command dumps the error log of a dynamic RAM module specified by slot number. The table in Fig. 15 shows a section of the error log display. The POSITION refers to the same position on the physical RAM module. One position contains one memory chip. The errors can occur as

ND-10.004.01

---

## Page 58

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
## PROGRAMMING GUIDE FOR THE MPM-5 SYSTEM

- soft errors, i.e., the error will disappear if the correct contents are written back to the memory
- hard errors, i.e., there is not possible to change the contents of the memory

These two types of errors can again occur as

- single bit errors, or
- multiple bit errors.

If there are hyphens in the error log, no error is detected in the memory chip in the corresponding position on the memory module. If there is a number there, the number indicates how many errors have been detected since the last reset of the error log. The letter H after the number indicates a HARD error, and no letter indicates a SOFT error.

The error reporting can be suppressed by setting bit 1 in the RAM control register to '1'. When this is done, previously detected single-bit hard errors are not reported. This means that, if the value 5H is found in a position in the error log, there has been 4 soft errors and 1 hard error. Identical hard errors are not subsequently reported. When the reporting of single-bit hard errors is suppressed, the error codes of detected errors are loaded in the suppress error table on the RAM module. See page 27.

If bit 1 in the RAM control register is '0', all hard errors are reported. If a memory chip has a hard error, this error is then reported very often. This is not always desirable.

- **PREVIOUS**: Looks at previous location.
- **ADDITIONAL-FORMAT** {FORMAT (HEX, DEC, ASCII)}: Gives the value of the location in the desired format.
- **LOOP-ON**: Starts a continuous read of the location. The command may be used in test and debug operations. Values may also be read continuously if the PERMIT-DEPOSIT command has been given.
- **LOOP-OFF**: Stops the LOOP-ON.

## 2.16 VALUE

**Parameter**: Number

With this command, it is possible to give a value in one of the radixes octal, decimal or hexadecimal and convert the value to the other two radixes. Default input radix is octal. Decimal input can be achieved by typing D after the value, and hex. input by typing H.

**Example**:

|              |         |
|--------------|---------|
| ➤VALUE-|     |         |
| NUMBER:16-|  |         |
| 16B       | 14      | EH     |

### 2.17 Initiate-EEPROM

**Parameters:**
- Slot number
- Date (Year, Month, Day (YYMMDD))
- Old contents will be lost - continue? (Yes/No)

This command is only used when an EEPROM is replaced by a new one. There is one EEPROM on each memory module, and one in the backwiring. To initiate the one in the backwiring, you have to give the slot number of the controller module.

### 2.18 Look-At-EEPROM

**Parameters:**
- Slot Number
- Address

This command lists a location in the EEPROM.

### 2.19 IO-Formats

**Parameters:**
- Input (Oct, Hex, Dec)
- Address
- Data
- Size (Byte, Word, Double word)

This command may be used to format the command MEMORY-DUMP. Data can then be displayed as octal, decimal or hexadecimal values and as bytes, words or double words.

### 2.20 LOOK-AT-IO

**Parameter:** Word Address

This command may be used to perform I/O read/write on the MPM-5 bus. The commands are listed in Fig. 16, Fig. 17 and Fig. 18. To find the word address, you have to:

- Take the octal value of the slot number of the port or RAM modules and multiply by 2.
- Place the calculated value in the position marked xx in the word address.

**Example:**

If you want to read the contents of the slot identification on the RAM module in slot position 17(decimal), you do as follows:

- 17(decimal) X 2 = 34(decimal)
- 34(decimal) = 42B
- From Fig. 18 you find that 'read slot identification' has the word address xx0000.
- The complete word address is then 420000.

### 3 START-UP AND INITIALIZATION OF THE MPM-5 SYSTEMS

> **NOTE:** When boards are moved in and out of the crate,  
> always first disable the error investigator with the command DISABLE-ERROR-INVESTIGATOR.

#### 3.1 The very first Start-up

A special procedure has to be completed prior to starting up the MPM-5 for the very first time. The procedure implements several commands in the Test and Maintenance program, described in chapter 2. The procedure is as follows:

- >INITIATE-EEPROM
- >CONFIGURATE-SLOT
- >LIST-CONFIGURATION
- >MEMORY-TEST
- >SYNDROME-TEST
- >AUTO-INITIATE-BANK

The MPM-5 is now ready for normal operation.

#### 3.2 Initialization after COLD Start or WARM Start

After COLD start or WARM start, the MPM-5 is automatically initialized with the information contained in the EEPROM in the backwiring.

#### 3.3 System Expansion

When you want to expand the MPM-5 system, you have to configure the new modules with the CONFIGURATE-SLOT command.

When new RAM-boards are added, remember to raise the upper address limit.

### 4 ERROR MESSAGES AND FAULTFINDING

| NOTE: When boards are moved in and out of the crate, always first disable the error investigator with the command DISABLE-ERROR-INVESTIGATOR. |

#### 4.1 Error Messages

Any error during normal operation of the MPM-5 systems makes one of eight different error messages appear on the console terminal. The error messages contain information from which the error source can be decoded.

The error-logs are updated for every memory cycle. When errors occur, the error logs are locked, and will not be opened before their contents are read. Thus the information on the error-causing cycle is saved.

The information in the error-logs is a great help in locating the error source, but the information has to be decoded in order to be understandable.

The error messages for occurring bus errors are:

* MPM-5 BUS ERROR (MEMORY CYCLE) - TIMEOUT - *
* MPM-5 BUS ERROR (MEMORY CYCLE) - FATAL - *
* MPM-5 BUS ERROR (MEMORY CYCLE) - WRITE PARITY - *
* MPM-5 BUS ERROR (IO CYCLE)
* MPM-5 BUS ERROR (MEMORY CYCLE) - CORRECTED ERROR - *
* MPM-5 BUS ERROR (MEMORY CYCLE) *

Two lines of standard information always follow these six error messages.

ND-10.004.01

## Page 76

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
## ERROR MESSAGES AND FAULTFINDING

### Example:

```
* MPM-5 BUS ERROR (MEMORY CYCLE) - C O R R E C T E D  E R R O R - *
MAINT.STAT:147122 ERRLOG 1:000001B ERRLOG 2:031460B ERRLOG 3:01522B
MASTER: 000016 SLAVE: 000019 ADDRESS: 000001B SYNDROME:000122B
```

The upper line contains the value of the maintenance status register and the values of the error logs. The lower line contains information that is decoded from the upper line, but this is not sufficient to find the error source. The different codes in both lines are therefore explained in detail in the following part of this section. After all the codes have been explained, some examples are given to show you how all this information is used.

### MAINT.STAT:

This code represents the contents of the **maintenance status register** on the controller module. The different bits have the following meaning:

## ERROR MESSAGES AND FAULTFINDING

### MASTER:

The **MASTER** code gives the slot number of the module that was master during the error-causing cycle.

Modules can be either masters or slaves. In general, modules that 'ask' on the multiport bus are masters, and modules that 'answere' are slaves. But this also depends on what the master asks for, and when it appears on the bus. Finally, it also depends on the physical design of the system.

### SLAVE:

This code gives the slot number of the module that was slave during the error-causing cycle. When you have the slot number of both the master and the slave involved, you know that the error has occurred in one of these modules.

The SLAVE code may also be zero. This means that no slaves have answered the request from the MASTER.

### ADDRESS:

The address code is decoded from bits 0-4 in the error-log 1 and represents the MPM5-bus address bits 18-22. With these bus address bits it is possible to locate the rows of chips on the memory board where the faulty chip is sited. When you have both the SYNDROME code and the address code, it is possible to locate the single chip.

You can find the rows of chips on the memory board by using the table in Fig. 2A. Note that the decoding is different for the 1 Mbyte memory module and for the 4 Mbyte memory module.

Address bits 18-22 cover only the first 8 Mbyte of your memory. If you have more than 8 Mbyte, the address code will start at zero for the next 8 Mbyte. The decoding of chips then goes as for the first 8 Mbyte. To be sure, you can check the SLAVE code to see which RAM module is failing.

*Fig. 24. Row of Chips decoded from Address Bits*

### SYNDROME:

The SYNDROME code is decoded from bits 3-9 in the error-log 3. After you have located the two rows of chips, you can find the faulty chip by using the syndrome code. The table in Fig. 25 shows which syndrome codes refer to the specific chips. The chip number refers to the number found in Fig. 26 on page 70.

**Fig. 26. Memory Chips on the Memory Module**

## EXAMPLE 1:

You are now going to decode the error message

\* MPM-5 BUSERROR (MEMORYCYCLE) - C O R R E C T E D E R R O R - \*

MAINT.STAT: 147122 ERRLOG 1: 000001B ERRLOG 2: 031460B ERRLOG 3: 015222B  
MASTER: 000016 SLAVE: 000019 ADDRESS: 000001B SYNDROME: 000122B  

Since this is a corrected error, you know that a **memory module** is involved. The memory modules can only be slaves, so slot number 19 contains the possible failing memory module.

To find the faulty chip you first have to look at the ADDRESS code, which here is 1. If you look at Fig. 24 on page 68, you will find the chip in one of the rows J or H on the memory module, if you assume that this is a 1 Mbyte module.

ND-10.004.01

## Page 85

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

## ERROR MESSAGES AND FAULTFINDING

Now you have to look at Fig.25 on page 69 to decode the SYNDROME code. In this case the SYNDROME code is 122B. From the table you can see that the code 122 refers to chip number 10 in position 15H on the memory module. You have then found the faulty chip.

### EXAMPLE 2:

You are now going to decode the error message

```
*   MPM-5   BUSERROR   (MEMORYCYCLE)   -   T I M E O U T   -   *
MAINT.STAT:147122  ERRLOG 1:003037B  ERRLOG 2:02005E9  ERRLOG 3:004001B
MASTER: 000014 SLAVE: 000000 ADDRESS: 000037B SYNDROME:00000B
```

The **MASTER** here is the controller module in position 14. This you can see from bits 8-12 in the maintenance status register described on page 62.

The **SLAVE** code is zero, which means that no module has answered the request from the **MASTER**.

To find out what sort of timeout has occurred, you have to look at bits 8-10 in error-log 1. In this case, error-log 1 has the value 003037B, which means that bits 9 and 10 are set. If you now look at these bits in the table in Fig.19 on page 64, you will see that the controller has not received ADDRESS READY and DATA READY from any memory module.

The value of the ADDRESS code is 37B, which means that all the bus address bits in error-log 1 are set. Possible error causes can be:

- *missing answer from a memory module*
- *the controller has sent wrong address*

If the **MASTER** had been a port, possible error causes could have been:

- *the limits on the port do not conform to the limits on the memory modules*
- *error in cabling*

# MULTIPORT MEMORY 5 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
## ERROR MESSAGES AND FAULTFINDING

Two other error messages can also appear during normal operation of the MPM-5 system:

    MPM-5 CORRECTED ERROR (SOFT), SLOT: <slot number>

    MPM-5 CORRECTED ERROR (HARD), SLOT: <slot number>

These error messages only occur if the error investigator is ON. This means that they only come up if the controller module discovers the error. The EEPROM on the memory board will be updated and the DUMP-ERROR-LOG command will show memory matrix with the position of the faulty chip.
