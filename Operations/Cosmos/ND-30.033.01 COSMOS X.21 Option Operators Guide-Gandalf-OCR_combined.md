INTRODUCTION

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Synopsis

The first part of this chapter gives a short introduction to the CCITT network protocol X.21, starting with a section about system prerequisites.

The second part gives a short presentation of the COSMOS X.21 Product.

The last part outlines the different processes involved in the product.

### 1.2 The CCITT X.21 Standard

The CCITT X.21 Standard is a general purpose interface between Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Circuit terminating Equipment (DCE) for synchronous operation on public data networks. It is the so-called line switched network type.

| Your responsibility | Carriers' responsibility      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| ![DTE]              | ![DCE]  X.21 Public Data Network |
| ![DCX]              |                               |

Figure 1. A Sketch of an X.21 Connection

The broken vertical line denotes the X.21 interface.

The X.21 system must always run on an ND-100 computer, or the 100 part of the ND-500 computer.

# COSMOS X.21 OPTION OPERATOR GUIDE
## INTRODUCTION

The DTE may also be a gateway for a COSMOS LAN, where it will provide the users with the same functions as provided inside the LAN. This means that you can access any remote ND system in the X.21 network and use any of the following ND communication applications:

- **RTA** - Remote Terminal Access
- **FA** - File Access
- **FT** - File Transfer
- **RS** - Remote Spooling  
- etc.

The figure below illustrates two connection types:

## 1.3 The Different Processes of COSMOS X.21

In the figure below, the protocol relationship between the different products/processes in a COSMOS environment are sketched:

| | Remote Spooling | | | Remote File Access | ND-MAIL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | File Trans. | TAD | T-Lib | XM Lib | RPC-LIB |
| | | XMSG Transport Layer |
| | | XMSG Network/Datagram Layer |
| | X.21 Network Server | X.25 Netw Server | XMSG XLAP (Mini LAPB) | Ethernet Network Server |
| | | X25.3 (PL) |
| | | X25.2 (LAPB) |
| X.21 Driv. | HDLC DMA Driver | Megalink Driver | Ethernet Driver |

*Figure 3. Protocol Relationship within a COSMOS Networking System*

As shown in the figure above, COSMOS X.21 uses the same link level protocol, X25.2, as COSMOS X.25 Option. The CCITT term for the process is Link Access Procedure Balanced (LAP B).

```

*Figure 4. The COSMOS X.21 Option Protocols*

When a connection is established (and no timeout has occurred), the data will flow directly between the XMSG Network/Datagram Layer and the network server, which sends the data to the link level process (CX21L0). The link level process will pass the data to the HDLC driver which handles the HDLC interface card.

The number of HDLC links must be specified when ordering SINTRAN. The maximum number will normally be 4 links. For details, see the Program Description document that comes with the system floppy diskettes.

## 1.4 The Different X.21 Processes

The SINTRAN RT names of the different X.21 real-time processes are listed in the table below:

| SINTRAN RT name | Type of process                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| X21NS           | COSMOS X.21 Network Server             |
| CX21L0          | COSMOS X.21 Link Level process no. 0   |
| CX21L1          | COSMOS X.21 Link Level process no. 1   |
| CX21L2          | COSMOS X.21 Link Level process no. 2   |
| CX21L3          | COSMOS X.21 Link Level process no. 3   |
| CX21LTM         | COSMOS X.21 Link Timer process         |
| CX21PF          | COSMOS X.21 Power Failure process      |
| CX21LG          | COSMOS X.21 Log process                |

Table 1. The SINTRAN RT Names of the Different X.21 Processes

These SINTRAN RT processes (programs) above constitute the real-time environment of the COSMOS X.21 Option. Together with the HDLC interface card and the operating system prerequisites (i.e., SINTRAN drivers and special monitor calls) and COSMOS Basic Module, COSMOS X.21 Option offers the end user totally transparent solution.

In the following chapter we will explain the steps necessary to operate — start, stop and configure — a COSMOS X.21 Option network.

### 2 HOW TO START COSMOS X.21 OPTION

#### 2.1 Synopsis

This chapter explains the XMSG commands necessary to operate the COSMOS X.21 Option.

After an introductory explanation of the XMSG command program, the different steps involved in the operation of X.21 are introduced sequentially.

#### 2.1.1 System Prerequisites

Before reading any further, you should make sure you install your COSMOS X.21 Option properly.

This is explained in the Product Description document, that comes with the system floppy diskettes.

When you have loaded the system, include the command

```
@MODE X21INS-LOAD-SEGM:MODE,,,,
```

in the SINTRAH MENT-MODE file after XMSG has been loaded.

It is possible to follow the procedures explained in this chapter manually and step by step start the system.

#### 2.1.2 The XMSG-COMMAND Program

This command program is the central tool of all COSMOS networking systems. The product XMSG binds together the different options available under the COSMOS 'umbrella' and its command program is the central tool for the system supervisor/operator. 

ND-30.033.01

## Page 18

# 2.1.3 Special X.21 XMSG Commands

The following XMSG commands are of special interest when operating the COSMOS X.21 Option:

| Command |
|---------|
| *Define-network-direct-connection |
| *Define-network-local-endpoint |
| *Define-network-remote-endpoint |
| *Define-network-remote-groupnumber |

Table 3. The General XMSG Commands

See appendix A for an extensive description of the different commands necessary to operate COSMOS X.21 Option. For a complete explanation of all the XMSG commands, see the COSMOS Operator Guide.

### 2.1.4 Explanation of Parameters

An explanation of the most commonly used input parameters to the XMSG-COMMAND program is included in Appendix B. All the special X.21 parameters are included.

### 2.2 The X21-NET-START:MODE File

In this section we will have a closer look at the X21-NET-START:MODE file. The different commands will be explained as they appear in the mode file. Below is an example of what the mode file may look like after all the substitutions explained in the Product Description document are done.

| Example 1. The X21-NET-START:MODE File |

Note that this is only an example, but it is based upon the startup mode file on the system floppy diskettes. The system included startup mode file may change, so you must compare it to the example above before beginning to include your own connection definitions.

ND-30.033.01

---

## Page 21

# COSMOS X.21 OPTION OPERATOR GUIDE

## HOW TO START COSMOS X.21 OPTION

The mode file should be called from the SINTRAN LOAD-MODE file after the XMSG startup mode file has been run. This is explained in the Program Description document.

```
@MODE (UTILITY)X21NS-NET-START:MODE...
```

It is impossible to start the COSMOS X.21 Option **before** XMSG has been started.

It is possible to define a new connection by giving the appropriate commands in the XMSG-COMMAND program. But each time the system is stopped, SINTRAN is restarted (warmstart) or XMSG is restarted, you have to give the same sequence of commands again to be able to reestablish your connection. Permanent connections should thus be defined in the X21NS-NET-START:MODE file.

In the following sections we will look at the different commands given in the startup mode file, explaining them in a way which should make you capable of configuring your X.21 system after your needs. The different commands are explained in the same sequence as they appear in the startup mode file.

In the examples below we assume that the commands are executed manually. All user input is underlined. For a complete explanation of the parameters see Appendices A and B.

### 2.2.1 How to Stop the X.21 System

There are two ways of stopping the X.21 system. The normal way is to give the XMSG command Stop-network-server, which will perform a normal closedown of the system. This is shown in the next section. In the following section we will explain how to stop the system if the Stop-network-server command does not work.

ND–30.033.01

## Page 22

# COSMOS X.21 OPTION OPERATOR GUIDE

## HOW TO START COSMOS X.21 OPTION

### 2.2.1.1 Normal Stopping Procedure

Normal stopping of the X.21 system is done as follows:

```
@(UTILITY)XMSG-COMMAND:PROG ␍
XMSG command program (ND-10130/10373H) of 84.01.14 09:13
Compiled for version 1983.07.13 (Release H)
XMSG Kernel version 1983.07.13 (Release H)
Options:
    ND-100 only. PIT3. Trace.
    Inter-system: File server. Network gateway.

X-C:STOP-NETWORK-SERVER X21NS␍
*- Warning: You can now bypass system protection mechanisms -*
OK

X-C:_
```

Example 2. Stopping the X.21 Network Server

When the network server is stopping a message, saying that the network server has stopped, is printed on the SINTRAN error device (console).

### 2.2.1.2 Manual Stopping Procedure

In some special situations it may not be possible to stop the X.21 system with the Stop-network-server command. Then you must abort the different processes manually, using the SINTRAN command ABORT. This is shown in the example below:

```
@ABORT X21NS␍
@ABORT CX2110␍
@ABORT CX2111␍
@ABORT CX211TM␍
@ABORT C251LG␍
```

Example 3. Manual Stopping of the X.21 Processes

The different RT programs names are abbreviations (or acronyms) for the process names. See chapter 1.

ND-30.033.01

---

## Page 23

# COSMOS X.21 OPTION OPERATOR GUIDE

## HOW TO START COSMOS X.21 OPTION

When the manual procedure has been used, you must patch one location (resetting a counter) on the segment 301 (the segment containing data and the TPS buffer pool). The procedure is shown below:

```
@LOOK-AT SEG 301
2064/ 0 0
0
```

Example 4. Initializing the Network Server

### 2.2.2 Initializing the X.21 Processes

When the network server has been initialized, the next step is to start the X.21 processes:

```
@RT X21NS
@CC Allow CONNECT from both sides
@LOOK-AT SEG 303
12506/ 0 1
12775/ 0 1

@RT CX21L0
@RT CX21L1
```

Example 5. Initializing the X.21 Processes

The reason for allowing CONNECT from both sides, which is not standard LAPB, is to speed up the establishment of a logical connection. One specified location for each link level routine must be patched (by changing its value from 0 to 1). In the example above, only two link level routines are used. In the standard X21NS-NET-START:MODE file, where four link level processes are used, four locations are patched.

### 2.2.3 Network Definitions

When all the processes have been successfully initialized or started, the next step is to define to the system the different names and DTE numbers of the systems in the network you want to establish a connection with. You must also identify to your own system your own DTE number(s).

The name of the local system is previously defined in the XMSG-START:MODE file.

## HOW TO START COSMOS X.21 OPTION

When the network server has been started successfully, you must define connections to the public network. Firstly you must identify to the system its own DTE number(s). At the same time you specify some of the configuration parameters. For a detailed description of the parameters, see Appendices A and B. All the DTE numbers used in this manual is fictious.

Example 8. Defining the Local Endpoint

After the local endpoint has been defined, you must identify the remote endpoints:

|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| OK                                                              |

Example 9. Defining the Remote Endpoints

The last step is to define the route to the system(s) at the remote end. These systems may also be beyond the remote X.21 gateway system.

| X-C:DEFINE-SYSTEM-ROUTE,,ORION,DOLE ↵ |
|--------------------------------------|
| OK                                   |

## HOW TO CONFIGURE THE COST PARAMETERS

### 3 HOW TO CONFIGURE THE COST PARAMETERS

#### 3.1 Synopsis

This chapter gives an outline of how to determine the cost parameters according to the different tariff structures yielding in different countries.

Information about the tariff structure yielding in your country should accompany the subscription agreement documents, issued by your local common carrier (PTT).

#### 3.2 The Cost Parameters

The three parameters `connect_charge`, `connect_cost` and `connect_time` of the command `Define-network-remote-endpoint` are all tied together in a way which is dependent of the tariff structure used by the PDN.

This implies that the meaning of a parameter may differ, depending on the differences in tariff structures. To be able to choose the correct strategy for your network system, you must consult your local PDN authority (common carrier).

In the following sections the three different cost parameters will be explained. It is important to be aware that it is the relationship between the parameters which determines the systems costs strategy, and not the different parameters by themselves.

The three parameters are all integers, subsequently you must transform your local currency into integers. In addition the parameter `connect cost` must be multiplied by 100 when used. This means that if the `connect cost` is 22, you must enter 2200.

In this manual, we define currency as the currency unit used in the different national tariffs. The currency unit in Germany is Pfennig. In Norway, Sweden and Denmark, the currency unit is øre (oere).

Generally we can say that the connect `charge` is what you have to pay for establishing (or trying to establish) a connection. The Connect `cost` is what you have to pay for keeping an active connection.

The names of the three parameters are:

| Parameter     | Unit                       | Type    |
|---------------|----------------------------|---------|
| Connect charge| (100*currency)             | Integer |
| Connect cost  | (currency/minute)          | Integer |
| Connect time  | (Basic Time Units)         | Integer |

In the following three sections we will give the three most important tariff structures.

ND-30.033.01

## Page 28

# 3.3 Call Charge Independent of Line Speed

Call charge independent of the line speed means that the cost is independent of the transmission speed of the lines used in a connection.

Then you should use only two of the three cost parameters below:

| Parameter         | Description                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `<connect charge>`| the charge specified in the tariffs.     |
| `<connect cost>`  | the cost specified in the tariffs.       |
| `<connect time>`  | not used (i.e., zero).                   |

It is important to remember that when one of the parameters is not used, it must always be zeroed.

# 3.4 Call Charge Dependent of Line Speed

If the call charge depends on the line speed, this is what you should input in the costs parameters:

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<connect charge>`| not used (i.e., zero).                                                                      |
| `<connect cost>`  | the cost specified in the tariffs.                                                          |
| `<connect time>`  | the ratio between charge specified in the tariffs and the cost specified in the tariffs. This value then gives time equivalent to the call charge. This value must be preceded with a minus sign ('-'). |

The formula to calculate the parameter `<connect time>` is as follows:

\[ \text{<connect time>} = \frac{\text{charge specified in tariffs}}{\text{cost specified in tariffs}} \]

Note that the **charge specified in the tariffs** in the formula above, must not be multiplied by the constant (i.e., 100) used when giving the parameter `<connect charge>`.

# COSMOS X.21 OPTION OPERATOR GUIDE  
## HOW TO CONFIGURE THE COST PARAMETERS

### 3.5 Minimum Time Charge

If the user is accounted for a minimum time (instead of a call charge), then the costs parameters should contain the following values:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \<connect charge\> | \<connect cost\> times \<connect time\> (must be specified).         |
| \<connect cost\>   | The cost specified in the tariffs.                                        |
| \<connect time\>   | The minimum time the user will be charged for.                            |

## Page 37

# COSMOS X.21 OPTION OPERATOR GUIDE
## THE X.21 RELATED XMSG COMMANDS

**EXPLANATION:** The four parameters, `<Charging request>`, `<Called line identification>`, `<Direct call>`, and `<Calling line identification>` are all called **X.21 facilities**. They may all be looked upon as switches, and may only be answered with **yes** or **no**.

| Parameter                   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Charging request            | The purpose of this facility is to give the DTE (your endpoint) charging information about the different connections which it is debited for. Used in connection with **charge transfer**. |
| Called line identification   | The purpose of this facility is to give the **calling DTE** (your endpoint) the identification of the **called DTE**.                                                               |
| Direct Call                 | The purpose of this facility is to simplify the call procedure when only one connection is used. Your endpoint will always call the same remote DTE when this service is used.     |
| Calling line identification | The purpose of this facility is to give the **called DTE** (your endpoint) the identification of the **calling DTE**, making it possible for the **called DTE** to deny a connection before it is fully established. |

Remember that the X.21 facilities prompts may only be answered by Yes or No.

All of the X.21 facilities are additional services. The purpose of this `group` parameter is to inform the network server that they are provided by the PTT and that you want to make use of these additional services.

| 1   | \<link block address> | \<all links>   |

**Rules**: Only permitted user SYSTEM.

**Related Commands**:  
Start-link  
Stop-link  
Start-network-server  
Stop-network-server  

**Function**: This command is used to list the current status of all links being used by XMSG. This means those started by the START-LINK or the START-NETWORK-SERVER commands. You may specify either XMSG link index or link block address.

A link reserved by a network server is a virtual link. The System Identification (Sysid) then refers to a virtual system within the local system and Sysid will be in the range of 9800 to 9803. Further, the figure in the LUN column, is the XMSG Port number and not the SINTRAN Logical Unit Number. The columns giving HDLC information, (Rcv, Xmit, Hard stat), will always be zero.

### Command name : LIST-ROUTING-INFO  

| No | Parameter Name:  | Default Value:        |
|----|------------------|-----------------------|
| 1  | \<from system\>  | \<local system\>      |
| 2  | \<to system\>    | \<all systems\>       |

Rules: Available to all user categories.

Related Commands: Define-system-route  
Remove-system-route

Function: This command lists the routing tables and checks the connections. The parameters \<from system\> and \<to system\> are both of type 'system' which means that 'system number' or 'system name' may be specified.

The command checks the network by sending connection requests to the remote system(s). It is advisable to identify the name of the \<to system\> if you have a lot of connections through a WAN. This is because of the fact that a public data network may be congested, so it may take minutes to get a complete list.

### EXPLANATION: Explanation of output parameters:

- **Path according to local tables** - this is how the route is defined on the system given in the \<from system\> input parameter.

- **Path according to tables** - this is how the route is defined on the system specified in the input parameter (via system) of the command DEFINE-SYSTEM-ROUTE and the following systems (if any).

- **Actual path** - The actual path of the connection. The 'actual path' and 'path according to tables' should be the same. All systems on the route to the target system will be listed here.

# Command name: LIST-SYSTEMS

| No: | Parameter Name: | Default Value: |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| 1   | \<system>       | \<all systems> |

**Rules**: Only permitted for user system if XMSG is older than version H.

**Related Commands**:  
List-names  
List-routing  

**Function**: Lists the system(s) that are defined in the local system's tables.

## Explanation

Description of the information listed:

- **Address**: Address of system block descriptor
- **Sysno**: System Number identificator
- **State**: >0 if connected, if <0, timeout while waiting for INIT.
- **Link**: Address of link block descriptor.
- **Subaddr**: Parameter to Network Server to find the way.
- **Send-seq-recv**: Send and receive sequence numbers for secure messages
- **Hops**: Number of LANs and WAN hops to this system (if state >0)

If the link is a virtual link to a network server, Sysno and Subaddr will display the same system number. This is because Sysno and Subaddr then identify a virtual system within the local system.
