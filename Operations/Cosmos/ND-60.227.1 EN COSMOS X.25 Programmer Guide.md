# COSMOS X.25 PROGRAMMER GUIDE
## INTRODUCTION TO THE X.25 PROGRAMMER LIBRARY

### 1 INTRODUCTION TO THE X.25 PROGRAMMER LIBRARY

#### 1.1 Introduction

This manual describes the COSMOS X.25 programmer library, which enables programs to set up connections and transfer data across an X.25 packet switching network. The library converts the caller's requests into messages, sent via XMSG, to an X.25 Packet Level (PL) module. It also converts messages received from the PL into events reported to the caller via a wait mechanism. The X.25 PL is described in the COSMOS X.25 Option Operator Guide, chapter 1.

The current implementation of the COSMOS X.25 programmer library supports a PLANC interface only. Some parameters are included in the interface but are not used by the current implementation of the library. These parameters are included to allow for future enhancements.

#### 1.2 Prerequisites for Establishing a Connection

##### 1.2.1 Initialization

The first routine to be called must be the initialization routine X25PINI. The purpose is to define a work area in your program so the library can work in a reentrant way. The library will use the work area for some of its own internal data structures. The library returns a workid, which is used to identify the work area in subsequent calls.

##### 1.2.2 Establishing Communication with the X.25 PL

A communication channel between your program and a particular X.25 PL module has to be created. This is done by calling the routine X25POPN. The communication channel is called a port and identified by a portid assigned to you by the library. The X.25 PL module controls one (and only one) physical communication line at a time. If you need to set up X.25 connections over more than one physical line, you must repeat the X25POPN call to establish communication with the same number of X.25 PL modules.

A Network Service Access Point (NSAP or just SAP) defines a conceptual point which provides access to the X.25 network service. The library returns an identifier (portid) belonging to the SAP. A SAP is implemented as a DTE number plus a SAP suffix. For the different types of SAP suffixes, please see the description of the X25PATR routine.

### 1.2.3 Setting up Connection End Points (CEPs)

A Connection End Point (CEP) defines a conceptual point at which a connection can take place. CEPs are used by the library and the PL to allocate certain resources for future connections. If an established connection is subsequently disconnected, these resources are not released, but are held ready for the next connection on the same CEP. The resources are only released when the CEP is deleted.

The number of CEPs needed is the sum of:

a) The maximum number of simultaneous Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) connections.

b) The number of Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) to be used.

A CEP is defined by calling the Attach Request routine X25PATR. The library and PL allocate resources such as internal buffers, and then take action depending on the type of connection required (incoming SVC, outgoing SVC, or PVC):

1) **Incoming SVC.** The PL informs the library (and hence the user program) of incoming calls that satisfy the required conditions. That means either the incoming call specifies the DTE subaddress corresponding to the CEP, or the incoming call data field (CUD) contains the string required by the CEP. Incoming calls that do not satisfy these conditions, are not routed to this CEP.

Norsk Data ND-60.227.1 EN

## Page 13

# COSMOS X.25 PROGRAMMER GUIDE  
## INTRODUCTION TO THE X.25 PROGRAMMER LIBRARY

2) **Outgoing SVC.** No special actions are taken.

3) **PVC.** The PL reserves the specified PVC number for exclusive use by this CEP.

The library returns an identifier (the cepid) to be used in subsequent calls. The user also specifies an identifier (ucepid) when calling X25PATR. The library uses this ucepid when informing the user that an event has occurred. This mechanism enables both the library and the user program to use simple look-up tables to identify information about CEPs.

When the X25PATR routine has been called, you should wait for an Attach Confirmation event. Changes to the NIDU sizes or other values made by the PL can be examined by calling the routine X25PATC.

### 1.3 Establishing a Connection

#### 1.3.1 Requesting an Outgoing Connection

You initiate an outgoing connection by calling the Connect Request routine X25PCNR. This specifies the DTE number of the called CEP, any special facilities required (for example reversed charging, fast select option), and any user data to be sent with the call. You must then wait for an event to arrive from the other side. This will be either:

a) A connection confirmation event, which tells you that the call has been accepted. The routine X25PCNC should be called when this event occurs in order to obtain the DTE address of the responder (may be different from the called address because of re-routing), the facilities granted by the other

Norsk Data ND-60.227.1 EN

# COSMOS X.25 PROGRAMMER GUIDE
## INTRODUCTION TO THE X.25 PROGRAMMER LIBRARY

side, and any user data sent with the connection acceptance. The connection is now established and data transfer can take place.

b) A disconnect indication event, which tells you that the call has been refused. The reason for refusal is given in the event data. Any user data sent with the disconnect indication can be obtained by calling the routine X25PDCI.

### 1.3.2 Accepting or Rejecting an Incoming Connection

An incoming connection satisfying the conditions for a CEP is signalled by a connection indication event. The called and calling DTE addresses, requested facilities and user data may be obtained by calling the routine X25PCNI. Note that the facilities may have been reduced by the network from those requested by the other side.

If the CEP was set up specifying a 4-step connection procedure, you must decide whether to accept or reject the connection request. If you decide to accept it, you call the routine X25PCNA. This specifies the full DTE address of the responding CEP, the facilities granted, and any user data to be sent with the connection acceptance. The connection is now established, and data transfer can take place. If you decide to reject the connection request, you call the routine X25PDCR, specifying the reason for refusal.

|---------------|--|---------------|

| X.25 PL | ← | X.25 PL |
| CONNECT REQUEST | ← | CONNECT RESPONSE |
| 3) CONNECT RESPONSE | → | |
| CONNECT RESPONSE | → | |
| 4) CONNECT CONF. | → | |

**Fig. 3. 4-step connection procedure**

If the CEP was set up specifying a 3-step connection procedure, the X25PCNA call should not be made. This is because this procedure assumes that the connection will always be accepted, so a connection acceptance is sent automatically by the PL. In this case, the connection is established when the connection indication event is received.

## 1.4 Data Transfer

### 1.4.1 Normal Data

Once a connection is established, normal data is sent to the remote user in units called NSDUs and NIDUs.

A Network Service Data Unit (NSDU) is a logical unit of data transported between network layer entities. An NSDU is subdivided into Network Interface Data Units (NIDUs). The Data Request routine X25PDAR transmits one NIDU, and these may be grouped into an NSDU by specifying the Moredata flag with all NIDUs except the last. The Qualifier flag may also be specified to distinguish between two types of data (for example commands and ordinary data). Note that the same value of the Qualifier flag must be specified for all NIDUs comprising a single NSDU.

That data has arrived from the other end is specified by the Data Indication event. You may obtain the data by calling the routine X25PDAI, specifying a buffer where you want the data to be stored. The flag values specified by the remote end are returned.

An alternative method of obtaining the data, and one that improves the efficiency of the library and X.25 PL, is to call the routine X25PRPB before waiting for a data indication event. X25PRPB specifies a buffer in advance of the event, so the data can be transferred without delay. When the data indication event occurs, X25PDAI can be called, and the details of the buffer used are returned. Note that X25PRPB can only be used for normal data, and only one buffer can be specified per incoming NIDU.

## Page 16

# 1.4.2 Expedited Data

This is a limited amount of data (currently one byte at a time) which you can send to the remote user, during the data transfer phase, outside the ordinary data stream. Expedited data is sent by calling X25PEDR. The arrival of the expedited data will be signalled to the remote user, by the Expedited Data indication event, before any normal data subsequently sent. The remote user obtains the expedited data by calling the routine X25PEDI.

Only one item of expedited data can be sent at one time. You have to wait until you receive an Expedited Data confirmation event before you send more expedited data.

# 1.5 Reset

## 1.5.1 Requesting a Reset

You request a reset by calling the routine X25PRSR. This causes all outstanding events to be lost, and may cause the loss of data previously sent. You must then wait for a Reset Confirmation event before sending any more data across the connection.

## 1.5.2 Accepting a Reset

When a Reset Indication event occurs, any other outstanding events are lost. You must reply by calling the Reset Accept routine X25PRSA.

# 1.6 Disconnect And Closing Down

An established connection is disconnected by calling the routine X25PDCR. This results in a Disconnect Indication event being received by the other side. No more data can be sent on this connection. However, a new connection cannot be set up on the same CEP before a Disconnect Confirmation event is received from the PL.

A CEP can be removed by calling the routine X25PDTR. The cepid becomes invalid and must not be used in subsequent calls.

Communication with an X.25 PL module can be closed down by calling the routine X25PCLS. The portid becomes invalid and must not be used in subsequent calls.

## INTRODUCTION TO THE X.25 PROGRAMMER LIBRARY  

### 1.7 The Wait routine and event mechanism

In order to wait for incoming events, the user program must call the routine X25PWAI. The parameters that can be specified are:

**Timeout:** The maximum length of time you have decided to wait. A Timeout event will occur if this time expires. The timeout may be of infinite duration.

**Requested Event:** Specifies the event(s) you wait for and which CEPs they should occur on. You specify the events as a bit mask (see values in the table of events) or any event may be specified. Events on a single CEP, all CEPs on a port, or all CEPs may be specified.

When a suitable event occurs, the X25PWAI routine returns the control to you, and indicates which type of event has occurred on which CEP. Only one event is signalled by each call of X25PWAI. Any other events that occur are stored by the library, and can be picked up by subsequent calls of X25PWAI.

The symbols for the event codes are defined in the X25P:DEFS file. You may specify a whole set of events by using logical OR to form a bit mask.

| Event code    | Value  | Explanation                     |
|---------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| X25evtime     | 1      | Timeout                         |
| X25evatcf     | 2      | Attach confirmation             |
| X25evcnin     | 4      | Connect indication              |
| X25evcncf     | 8      | Connect confirmation            |
| X25evdain     | 16     | Data indication                 |
| X25evxdin     | 64     | Expedited data indication       |
| X25evxdcf     | 128    | Expedited data confirmation     |
| X25evrsin     | 256    | Reset indication                |
| X25evrscf     | 512    | Reset confirmation              |
| X25evdecin    | 1024   | Disconnect indication           |
| X25evdeccf    | 2048   | Disconnect confirmation         |
| X25everin     | 4096   | Error indication                |
| X25evunkn     | 8192   | Unrecognized XMSG interrupt     |
| X25evothr     | 16384  | Other interrupt                 |
| X25evcrdt     | -32768 | May send more data              |

The reason for X25evunkn is that you may combine calls to the X.25 library and to XMSG in the same RT program. As you performed the X25PWAI call, to wait for an event, a message may arrive on a port opened by an XMSG call. The X25evunkn tells you that this has happened.

The X25PWAI routine performs the 'tmout' monitor call internally. If your RT-program becomes rescheduled for execution, by for example another program, the X25evothr event will occur.

# Dialing

A dial out procedure implemented using device independent subroutines could look as follows:

```c
...
switch ( DialStatus )
{
    case 0 :
    case 1 :  
        printf ("Connection to Remote Host Established\n");
        break;
    case 2 :
        printf ("No Dial Tone\n");
        break;
    case 3 :
        printf ("No Carrier\n");
        break;
    case 4 :
        printf ("Voice Answer\n");
        break;
    case 5 :
        printf ("Dialing Error\n");
        break;
    case 6 :
        printf ("Line Busy\n");
        break;
    case 7 :
        printf ("Blacklisted\n");
        break;
    case 8 :
        printf ("Timeout\n");
        break;
    case 9 :
        printf ("Invalid Phone Number\n");
        break;
    default :
        printf ("Unknown Error\n");
}
...
```

The program fragment calls a dialing routine, dials a telephone number, and passes a status code back. The status code indicates whether a connection to a remote host has been established or if there was an error. In the latter case, a code indicating the cause of the error is available.

### FUNCTION
Attach request.

### Explanation
This call is used to define a connection endpoint (CEP), and the PL will allocate the necessary resources such as datafields. X25patr is necessary for incoming as well as outgoing connections.

**Conndetails** describes the type of connection. It can take one of the following values: PVC, SVC outgoing, or SVC incoming. 

For PVCs the PVC number is also required.

For SVCs information about connection protocol and SAP suffix is required.

Connection protocol defines the behavior of the PL for incoming calls. Possible values are 3-step connect or 4-step connect. Please refer to page 6.

Norsk Data ND-60.227.1 EN

## Page 28

# SAP Suffix

SAP suffix is used to select conditions for receiving incoming calls, either by selecting a DTE subaddress or by matching some or all of the contents of the Call User Data (CUD) field (in the packet header). For outgoing calls, only the DTE subaddress may be specified, and this will be appended to the calling address when a Connect Request is made.

The SAP suffix consists of either a DTE subaddress (max. 4 digits), a CUD string specification, or a CUD byte specification. If you set the SAP suffix to NIL, then the DTE subaddress is selected.

CUDstring specifies an ASCII character string (max. length 16) and a start position. Incoming calls are routed to this CEP if the string appears in the corresponding position in the incoming CUD.

CUDbyte is similar to CUDstring except that the values are specified as integers rather than bytes. This allows special values to be used, e.g. to accept any value for a byte (wild card).

The structures for specifying the connection details are defined as follows:

```plaintext
TYPE X25Connections = ENUMERATION(X25PVC, &  
                                   X25SVCincoming,X25SVCoutgoing)

TYPE X25ConnDetails = RECORD  
  X25connections: X25Conntype

These are the structures for specifying the SAP suffix:

### TYPE X25SAPsuftype = RECORD
- ENUMERATION(X25CUDbstring, X25CUDbyte, &X25DTESub): X25SAPtype
- INTEGER: X25suflength

ENDRECORD

X25maxDTEsubsize = 4 and X25maxsufsize = 16.

A wildcard value for X25CUDbyte is: X25anybyte = 1

The `sizes` parameter contains the following values:

- Maximum NIDU size for input.
- Maximum NIDU size for output.
- Minimum buffer pool request (not used at present).
- Maximum buffer pool request (not used at present).

The maximum NIDU sizes are used to determine the size of the XMSG buffers. If sizes is NIL, both NIDU sizes are set to 128.

### FUNCTION
Data indication.

### Explanation
When data is received, it is signalled to you via the X25vdai n event. X25PDAI is called to obtain one NIDU. If you have not provided the packet level with a buffer by using X25PPRB, the buffer specified by the parameters udata and ubufid is used. Otherwise, the buffer details specified in a previous call to X25PPRB are returned in the parameters udata and ubufid.

The flags parameter is set to the value specified in the X25PDAR sent by the remote end.

| 4   | retstat Integer      | W   | Return status.                       |

## FUNCTION

Data request.

### Explanation

This call is used to send one NIDU to the other end of the connection. Here are the possible values of `retstat` for this call:

- **X25ok**: The data is sent to the local PL.
- **X25errcrdt**: Retry later. Data cannot at present be sent to the PL since the window is full. The caller must wait for an X25evcrdt event before retrying X25PDAR.

The M-bit (more data) is defined by setting flags to X25moredata. The Q-bit (qualifier) is defined by setting flags to X25qualifier. Note that the Q-bit must be the same value in all NIDUs "linked" by the use of the M-bit. The combination X25moredata + X25qualifier may be used.

The symbols are included in the X25P:DEFS file.

### FUNCTION
Disconnect indication.

### Explanation
An incoming disconnect request is perceived by your packet level as a disconnect indication. This is signalled to you via an X25evdci event. X25PDCI gives you the information associated with this event.

Originator is specified by the following record defined in the X25P:DEFS file:

```
TYPE X25origtype = RECORD
    X25originator : X25orig
ENDRECORD

TYPE X25originator = ENUMERATION (X25user, X25provider).

## FUNCTION

Disconnect request.

## Explanation

The purpose of this call is one of the following:

1. To refuse a connection request from a remote user, signalled by an X25evcnin event.

2. To terminate an established connection.

Any outstanding buffered data not yet sent to the remote CEP is flushed. The same is true for received data not yet given to you.

When the disconnect is complete, this will be signalled to you via the X25evdccf event.

No other calls may be invoked on the connection after you have done an X25pdcr.

| 4  | workid Integer          | W   | Identifier specifying this work area in subsequent calls.                         |

## FUNCTION

Initialization. This must be the first call to the X.25 library.

## Explanation

The purpose of this call is to define a work area in your data space for internal data structures used by the X.25 Library. This allows the library to be re-entrant (i.e., only one copy is required for all users).

The work area contains information about X.25 ports, Connection End Points (CEPs), and user data buffer descriptors. The X.25 library is responsible for the operations on the work area and will format it appropriately. If the area is not large enough for the specified request, an error will be returned.

`maxvalues` is specified by the X25Maxima record defined in the X25P:DEFS file:

```
TYPE X25Maxima = RECORD
    INTEGER: X25ports
    INTEGER: X25ceps
    INTEGER: X25conns
    INTEGER: X25buffers
ENDRECORD
```

Norsk Data ND-60.227.1 EN

## Page 43

# COSMOS X.25 PROGRAMMER GUIDE

## X.25/PLANC REFERENCE GUIDE

X25conns is the maximum number of simultaneous connections. X25buffers is the maximum number of provided buffers. If you do not set these, the library sets them both to the value of X25ceps.

X25ports is the maximum number of ports. X25ceps is the maximum number of CEPs.

| 6   | retstat Integer     | W   | Return status. |
| 7   | portid Integer      | W   | Identifier for that part of the work area which this X25 module uses. |

## FUNCTION

Open port request.

## Explanation

Communication with a local X.25 Packet Level module is established by performing this call.

X25systemid and X25moduleno are used to connect to a local X.25 PL. If it is required to connect with more than one X.25 module (e.g. if there are several physical communication lines), an X25POPN call is needed for each X.25 module.

One entity may consist of several processes (RT-programs), but in most cases only one process constitutes the entity. Single-process entities will use the default value in this field (the entity id will be set by the library to the RT-program address). Multi-process entities will have to predefine an identifier, and this must not conflict with other multi-process entity identifiers.

| 2   | udata X25userdata    | R   | Data coming from the remote CEP. |
| 3   | ubufid Integer       | R   | Buffer identifier. Used for retrieving the buffer in X25PDAI. |
| 4   | retstat Integer      | W   | Return status. |

## FUNCTION

Provide buffer.

### Explanation

Incoming data can only be passed to the user when a buffer is provided for it. In the simple case, this buffer is specified by the X25PDAI routine which is called after the X25evdain event has occurred. However, this means that the data must be kept in an XMSG buffer until the routine is called. This can be inefficient and clog XMSG.

To avoid the problem, it is possible to specify user data buffers before X25PWAI is called. This is done with the X25PPRB call. When data arrives, it is immediately put into a provided buffer of sufficient size. In the subsequent call of the X25PDAI routine, the specified value of the user data parameter is ignored, but the address, length and buffer identifier of the buffer used will be returned.

At present only one specified buffer is allowed per incoming NIDU. If the buffer is not big enough to hold the data, as much of the data as possible is put in the buffer. The rest is lost, and a warning value (X25erbfsz) is returned in retstat.

Note that X25PPRB only applies to normal data, and not to user data passed by connect or disconnect calls, nor to expedited data.

**FUNCTION**: Reset response.

**Explanation**: The reset operation is a confirmed service. You must send a reset response to tell the remote CEP that you have received the reset indication event. The remote CEP is informed by the X25evrscf event that the reset request was confirmed.

**FUNCTION:** Reset request.

**Explanation:** The X25PRSR call clears the pipe between the two CEPs. Unacknowledged user data and expedited user data will remain unacknowledged.

The reason for reset is implemented as follows:

- High order byte - Reset cause.
- Low order byte - Diagnostic code.

The remote CEP perceives the reset request as a reset indication. The remote user is informed by the X25evrsin event. There is no corresponding reset indication call, since all information needed is supplied in the event data.

#### FUNCTION
Wait for event to occur.

#### Explanation
The X25tm type in timeout has the following definition:

```
TYPE X25tm = RECORD  
  X25tmcode: X25tmunits  
  INTEGER: X25tmlength  
ENDRECORD
```

- X25tmcode is defined as follows: 
  ```
  TYPE X25tmcode = ENUMERATION(X25tmbasic, X25tmses, X25tmins, X25tmhrs)
  ```

These units denote: basic time units, seconds, minutes, and hours respectively.

- X25tmlength describes the number of time units.

A value of X25infinitetime for (timeout.x25tmlength) specifies an infinite timeout period.

- reqevent specifies the event to wait for. It consists of an id and an eventcode. The id may be a plcepid (specifying a particular cep), a portid (specifying any cep in this port), or the workid (specifying any cep on any port). The eventcode specifies the events to be waited for. A value of X25anyevent may be used to accept any event.

- actevent is the event that actually occurred. It consists of a ucepid and an event code.

# acteventdata

`acteventdata` is additional data related to the event that occurred.

The contents are:

## For connect indication/ confirmation:
- `acteventdata(1)` - number of bytes of user data

## For data indication:
- `acteventdata(1)` - number of bytes of user data
- `acteventdata(2)` - flag settings

## For More data:
- `acteventdata(1)` - number of packets confirmed

## For expedited data indication:
- `acteventdata(1)` - value of first byte of data

## For Reset indication:
- `acteventdata(1)` - Resetreason

## For Disconnect indication:
- `acteventdata(1)` - Discreason
- `acteventdata(2)` - number of bytes of user data

## For error indication:
- `acteventdata(1)` - Error return value
- `acteventdata(2)` - Primitive that caused the error

## For ports/queues not known by the library:
- `acteventdata(1)` - XMSG port number

If the events X25everin, X25evunkn, or X25evothr occur, X25PWAI will return immediately. These events override any requested event/CEP combination.

## X25everin Events

For X25everin events one of the following values is returned in `acteventdata(2)`:

| Event Code | Description                       |

## ERROR CODES

### General errors:

- **X25erilcs** : Command illegal in this state
- **X25erbdid** : Specified id is invalid
- **X25erlpcg** : Packet level congestion
- **X25erinac** : Packet level inactive
- **X25erntcg** : Network congestion
- **X25erpltm** : Packet level timeout

### Errors specific to commands:

- **X25erwksz** : Workarea is too small (X25pini)
- **X25erptnm** : Maximum number of ports exceeded (X25popn)
- **X25eralcd** : Already listening for this condition (X25patr)
- **X25erforc** : Event forced due to lack of event space (X25pwai). The wait has been ended by an event that you were not waiting for, because there is no space left in the work area for storing more events.
- **X25ercpnm** : Maximum number of CEPs exceeded (X25patr)
- **X25ercnnm** : Maximum number of connections exceeded (X25pcnr)
- **X25erbfmn** : Maximum number of Buffers exceeded (X25pprb)
- **X25erbfsz** : Provided buffer too small (X25pdai). The buffer has been filled with the incoming data, but some data has been lost.
- **X25ernocp** : Message received for unknown CEP (X25pwai) - internal error
- **X25erumsg** : Unrecognized message from PL (X25pwai) - internal error
- **X25ernocn** : No connection available across the network (X25pcnr)
- **X25erilpv** : No PVC with this number (X25patr)
- **X25eratpv** : PVC already attached (X25patr)
- **X25eralxd** : Expedited data already sent but not yet confirmed (X25pedr). X.25 does not allow more than one item of expedited data to be sent at a time.

Norsk Data ND-60.227.1 EN

## Page 62

# COSMOS X.25 PROGRAMMER GUIDE

## ERROR CODES

- **X25ernoxd** : No corresponding expedited indication (X25pedi). You have called the X25PEDI when there was no Expedited Data indication event.

- **X25eralrs** : Reset already sent but not yet confirmed (X25prsr). X.25 does not allow more than one reset to be done at a time.

- **X25ernors** : No corresponding reset indication (X25prsa). You have called X25PRSA when there was no reset indication event.

- **X25erflag** : Illegal data flags combination (X25pdar). When two or more packets are connected by use of the M-bit, they must have the same value of the Q-bit.

- **X25erilud** : Illegal user data length (X25pdar). The length specified is greater than the maximum length of a NIDU.

- **X25ercrdt** : Run out of credit for sending data (X25pdar). You must wait for an X25evcrdt event before sending more data.
