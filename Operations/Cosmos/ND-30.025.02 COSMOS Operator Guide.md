# External Voltage Compensation

If burner satisfactory performance is prevented by low incoming voltage or long supply wiring, apply voltage compensation at the burner control with the three models in Table 8. These control models are available with a compensator that adjusts for a 20% voltage reduction in the input power. If applicable, this voltage combination can also be installed on line wires near the control.

| Model    | Description                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| HFFC     | Combination burner/flame safeguard/control |
| MHD      | Flame safeguard replacement             |
| SFFD     | Simulated flame detector for testing        |

For potential performance problems in a power system, adjust the voltage as required, or modify the system to provide proper power. Be sure to measure voltage at the burner, especially on long feeder systems.

# CONTACT CONFIGURATION

Each control device chosen for application (or replacement part) should be listed in the following tables. Be sure to replace with exactly the same model configuration for correct operation. Different configurations or functions may cause poor or adversely modified control performance.

The following tables depict normal contact operation:

| Contact Type | Function                | Model Numbers          |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| SPST         | Low voltage             | HFFC, MHD              |
| SPDT         | High voltage            | SFFD, MHD              |

Remember, each model must be connected according to the wiring diagram attached to the equipment to ensure operational capability. Consult your local representative with any questions on model compatibility or wiring requirements before installation.

### 1 INTRODUCTION

#### 1.1 Synopsis

The first part of this chapter gives an introduction to data communication standards with reference to the International Standard Organization Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection, the OSI model.

The latter part describes the hardware and software requirements that have to be fulfilled to be able to run the COSMOS Basic Module.

#### 1.2 Introduction

COSMOS is Norsk Data's distributed communications environment. It provides communication and application services to augment the user services provided by SINTRAN III.

The COSMOS Basic Module provides the services necessary to run a minimal local network. These services are common to all COSMOS installations. Additional options can be added.

##### 1.2.1 The OSI Reference Model

The figure on the next page sketches the International Standard Organization Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnections, the OSI model.

## INTRODUCTION

According to the OSI Model, the COSMOS Basic Module offers the following services.

### Layer 1: Physical Layer
- V24 / V28 (RS232C) up to 19.2 kbps,
- V11 / X27 (RS422) up to 1 Mbps using
- ND HDLC-DMA or MEGALINK interface hardware.

### Layer 2: COSMOS Local Link Protocol
- Performs secure transmission with flow control and error recovery.
- It uses HDLC frame formats.

### Layer 3: COSMOS Network Layer
- Provides routing and global delivery of the Intersystem datagram Protocol Data Unit.
- COSMOS Networks allow for networks containing up to 64,000 systems (nodes or hosts).
- Since COSMOS handles all routing, the user does not need to be concerned with routing or communications facilities.

### Layer 4: Transport Layer
- At this layer, COSMOS provides the end-to-end transport functions needed by all the higher layers.
- Layer 4 is recommended for all user programs.
- This layer is documented in the COSMOS Programmer Guide, ND-60.164.

### Layers 5, 6, and 7
- These layers depend on the COSMOS application.
- See also the COSMOS User Guide, ND-60.163.

*Figure 3. OSI Layer 1*

The COSMOS Basic Module runs on all ND-100s, or the 100 part of ND-500 systems, and all Satellites as long as the following additional hardware requirements are fulfilled.

Depending on network configuration, one or more of the following communication interfaces has to be installed:

Communication Interfaces (Hardware):

- **HDLC-DMA**
- **ND MEGALINK**

The internal hardware configuration may cause problems when trying to install, for example, the ND MEGALINK card. Normally this problem is solved by a simple reconfiguration of the system.

### 2 HOW TO OPERATE XMSG

#### 2.1 Synopsis

The first part of this chapter gives an introduction to the XMSG-COMMAND program and defines certain key terms.

Then the different commands used in the start-up mode file are explained.

The last sections explain where to include the XMSG-START:MODE file in the SINTRAN LOAD-MODE:MODE file.

#### 2.2 The XMSG-COMMAND Background Program

XMSG-COMMAND is a background program that is used to control and supervise the XMSG system.

It can also be used for XMSG testing and benchmarking.

XMSG-COMMAND accepts commands in the usual SINTRAN way, with abbreviations being allowed and prompts for parameters that are not specified on the command line.

Any command line preceded with the @ sign will be handed over to the SINTRAN III background command processor for execution.

Many of the commands in the background program use privileged XMSG functions.

XMSG-COMMAND will automatically use the XFPRV function to make itself privileged when most of these functions are invoked, but this will be refused if the user is not logged in as 'SYSTEM'.

After having listed the most important XMSG commands for the operation of a point-to-point HDLC (Megalink) local area network, in the following sections we will examine a typical XMSG-START:MODE file, explaining the commands as they appear in the file.

---

## Page 35

# 2.3 The Most Important XMSG Commands

Appendix A of this manual contains a list of all the necessary commands to operate a point-to-point HDLC (Megalink) local area network.

In the table below these commands are listed:

| Command Name         | Command protection          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| CLEAR-PRIVILEGED     | Only user SYSTEM or RT      |
| DEFINE-LOCAL-SYSTEM  | Only user SYSTEM or RT      |
| DEFINE-REMOTE-NAME   | Only user SYSTEM or RT      |
| DEFINE-SYSTEM-ROUTE  | Only user SYSTEM or RT      |
| EXIT                 | All user categories         |
| GET-ERROR-MESSAGE    | All user categories         |
| HELP                 | All user categories         |
| LIST-LINKS           | Only user SYSTEM or RT      |
| LIST-NAMES           | All user categories         |
| LIST-ROUTING-INFO    | All user categories         |
| LIST-SYSTEMS         | All user categories         |
| REMOVE-SYSTEM        | Only user SYSTEM or RT      |
| SET-ADVANCED         | All user categories         |
| SET-PRIVILEGED       | Only user SYSTEM or RT      |
| START-LINK           | Only user SYSTEM or RT      |
| STOP-LINK            | Only user SYSTEM or RT      |

Table 1. The Most Common XMSG Commands

You should notice that only user SYSTEM has the privilege to perform all the commands necessary. Make it a rule to log in as user SYSTEM when manipulating with XMSG.

Because of this privilege, and the other privileges you have when logged in as user SYSTEM, you should not do anything unless you are certain about its consequences.

# 2.4 XMSG Installment Procedures

If you have not installed XMSG (and the COSMOS Basic Module) yet, read the Product Description Sheet supplied with the system floppy disks.

Make certain that you edit the XMSG-LOAD:MODE file correctly. The mode file should be started from the SINTRAN HENT-MODE:MODE file. Examples of these mode files are included in Appendix F.

When XMSG has been installed properly, the next step is to load and start XMSG. This procedure is looked upon in detail in the following sections.

### 2.5 The XMSG-START:MODE File

An example of the XMSG-START:MODE file is included in Appendix G, together with the other start-up mode files. However for your convenience, we will list the XMSG-START:MODE file here:

```
@CC  *** XMSG STARTUP MODE FILE FOR ND-999 ***

@STOP-XMSG
@EXIT
@HOLD 0 0
@HOLD 3 2

```

*Example 1. The XMSG-START:MODE File*

In the following section we will look upon the different commands in this mode file, in the same sequence as they appear and will explain what function they have and why they are performed.

### 2.5.1 Stopping XMSG

Stopping XMSG is done from the program SINTRAN-SERVICE. You must be logged in as user SYSTEM to start this program.

```
@SINTRAN-SERVICE ⏎  
*STOP-XMSG ⏎  
OK: XMSG terminated  
*_  
```

Example 2. Stopping XMSG

When the response 'OK: XMSG terminated' has been received, XMSG has stopped. You should be aware of the fact that stopping XMSG also clears all local XMSG tables. Subsequently, after XMSG has been stopped you have to rebuild those tables. This is shown later in this chapter.

Stopping XMSG will also normally clear all errors.

If XMSG does not run, this command will not have any affect.

### 2.5.2 Starting XMSG

After XMSG has been stopped, and all tables or error conditions cleared, the next step is to start XMSG. This is also done from the SINTRAN-SERVICE program:

```
@SINTRAN-SERVICE ⏎  
*START-XMSG ⏎  
OK: XMSG started  
*_  
```

Example 3. Starting XMSG

When the response 'OK: XMSG started' is displayed, XMSG is running, but since its local tables are blank, we must build up a new set of tables.

But first, you must EXIT the SINTRAN-SERVICE program.

### 2.5.3 Defining the System Names

Instead of referencing remote systems with integer numbers, we define symbolic system names instead. The first name we define is the symbolic name of your local system. In the examples below, we assume that the local system name is MAIN. In this version of XMSG you are not required to use the command DEFINE-LOCAL-SYSTEM, because this is done automatically when XMSG is initialized.

First we define the name of the local system. The number of the local system is 999. However, you are advised to use the command SET-PRIVILEGED first, to avoid getting warnings each time you execute a privileged command.

```
----------------------------------------------------------------

X-C:SET-PRIVILEGED↵  
*- WARNING: You can now bypass system protection mechanisms -*

X-C:DEFINE-REMOTE-NAME,MAIN,999↵  
OK  

X-C:_

----------------------------------------------------------------  
```

Example 4. Defining the Local System Name

When the symbolic name of the local system has been defined, we must define the names of the remote systems we want to define connections to. This is done as follows:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------

X-C:DEFINE-REMOTE-NAME,FORMAT,998↵  
OK  

X-C:DEFINE-REMOTE-NAME,BATCH,997↵  
OK  

X-C:DEFINE-REMOTE-NAME,TEST,996↵  
OK  

X-C:_

----------------------------------------------------------------  
```

Example 5. Defining Remote System Names

# 2.5.4 Defining the Route to the Remote Systems

The next step is to define the routes to the different remote systems. In the figure below, the network architecture of our example is illustrated:

```
   MAIN
   Local system
      |
   FORMAT
   Adjacent remote system
   /    \
BATCH  TEST
Remote systems
```

*Figure 7. An Illustration of a Point-to-Point Network*

When defining the route to remote systems, it is not necessary to define the route to the adjacent system(s). By adjacent system we mean the system to which the local system has a direct link. In other words, the system that is physically connected to the local system with an HDLC or Megalink cable.

So, in our example, it is only necessary to define the route to the two systems BATCH and TEST. This is shown in the example below:

| Command                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| X-C:DEFINE-SYSTEM-ROUTE,,BATCH.FORMAT ↵          |
| OK                                               |
| X-C:DEFINE-SYSTEM-ROUTE,,TEST.FORMAT ↵           |
| OK                                               |
| X-C:                                             |

*Example 6. Defining the Route to Remote Systems*

ND-30.025.02

## HOW TO OPERATE XMSG

### 2.5.5 Starting the Link

The last thing to do is to start the link. This is shown in the example below:

| X-C: START-LINK 1360,,,1,, |
|----------------------------|
| OK                         |
| X-C:                       |

*Example 7. Starting the Link*

And then, provided that XMSG has been started successfully on the other systems as well, our little network should be operative.

However, the network is not initialized yet. This can be done by executing the command LIST-ROUTING, answering all parameter prompts with CR (or commas). Then the network will initialize itself and the output of the command will list the routes to the different systems.

### 2.6 Other Important XMSG Commands

There are some other XMSG commands which are not used in the XMSG-START:MODE file, and consequently not covered in this chapter.

For a complete list of the different XMSG commands, see Appendix A.

### 2.7 SINTRAN Warm Starts

You should include the command

    MODE XMSG-START:MODE,,,,,

in the SINTRAN LOAD-MODE:MODE file after all directories have been entered. See Appendix F for example of SINTRAN LOAD-MODE:MODE file.

### 2.8 SINTRAN Cold Starts

You should include the command

    MODE XMSG-LOAD:MODE,,,,,,

in the SINTRAN HENT-MODE:MODE file after the subsystem MAIL has been started. See Appendix F for example of SINTRAN HENT-MODE:MODE file.

## THE CONNECT-TO SERVICE PROGRAM AND THE OPERATION OF TAD'S

### 3 THE CONNECT-TO SERVICE PROGRAM AND THE OPERATION OF TAD'S

#### 3.1 Synopsis

This chapter covers the SINTRAN commands necessary to operate the Terminal Access Devices (TAD's) and the commands of special interest to the system supervisor of the CONNECT-TO program.

Turn to the next chapter for an explanation of the SCRIPT facility of the CONNECT-TO program.

#### 3.2 The SINTRAN TAD Commands

There are three SINTRAN TAD commands you need to know. They are:

- @TADADM
- @START-TADADM
- @STOP-TADADM

In the following subsections we will explain the three different commands.

#### 3.2.1 The TADADM Command

The SINTRAN command @TADADM tells you the status of each Terminal Access Device (TAD):

| TAD/TYP | RESERV | ESCAP | PORTNO | - | PORTNO | TERMNO | USER | SYSTEM |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|---|--------|--------|------|--------|
| 768/0   | TAD01  | Enab  | Discon |   | 42     | UTILITY| SCHOLAR |
| 769/0   | TAD02  | Enab  | 10     | - | **This TAD has no corresponding PAD. |   |        |        |
| 770/0   | No     | Enab  | Discon |   |        |        |      |        |
| 771/0   | TAD04  | Enab  | 12     | - | 9      | 50     | SYSTEM | SOUTH |
| 772/0   | TAD05  | Enab  | 8      | - | 7      | 0      | **File Server Adm.** |        |

Local system information | Remote system information

Example 8. The TADADM Command

TAD's not in use should look like 770 above, while each TAD being used for a File Server should look like 772 above.

The information on the left is local system information: the TAD's are numbered from 768 and up, their "TYP" (type) should be 0. Reserved TAD's will normally be TAD01 for TAD 768, TAD02 for TAD 769, etc. These are all names of RT programs. "ESCAP" tells you whether or not ESCAPE is disabled on that terminal, and "PORTNO" tells you the XMSG.

---

## Page 45

# COSMOS Operator Guide

## THE CONNECT-TO SERVICE PROGRAM AND THE OPERATION OF TAD'S

The righthand side contains the following information: "PORTNO" is the port number on the remote system; "TERMNO" is the terminal number, i.e., the Logical Device Number, on the local system and "USER" and "SYSTEM" tell you the name of the user and his or her local computer system.

Note that TAD 769 has no Peripheral Access Device (PAD):

| 769/ 0 TAD02 Enab | 10 - **This TAD has no corresponding PAD. |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|

*Example 9. Example of a Hanging TAD*

Under certain circumstances this error situation occurs. When this happens, the TAD cannot be used for remote terminal access or for a File Server until you "fix" it by using the RECONNECT-TAD command of the CONNECT-TO Service program explained on later in this chapter.

### 3.2.2 The START-TADADM Command

The purpose of this command is to make the TAD service available, making it possible to log on a TAD from a remote system. The command is normally executed in the SINTRAN LOAD-MODE file. The command has no input parameters. Only user SYSTEM may use the command.

    @START-TADADM ↵

*Example 10. The START-TADADM Command*

ND-30.025.02

---

## Page 46

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## THE CONNECT-TO SERVICE PROGRAM AND THE OPERATION OF TAD'S

### 3.2.3 The STOP-TADADM Command

When this SINTRAN command is executed, it will not be possible to log on any of the TAD's. However, you should note that the operation of active TAD's is not affected by the command. In other words, if a user is logged on a TAD, s/he will not see any change.

Users who try to log on a TAD when TADADM has been stopped, will get the error message 'Remote terminal access not running on xxxxxx', where 'xxxxxx' denotes system name.

```
@STOP-TADADM ↓
```

Example 11. The STOP-TADADM Command

### 3.3 The CONNECT-TO Service Program

In this manual, we will only look at the Service commands. The commands in CONNECT-TO are adequately explained in the COSMOS User Guide, ND manual 60.163.

```
@CONNECT-TO ↓

COSMOS CONNECT-TO PROGRAM VERSION - B , NOVEMBER 28, 1983

CT-SERV:_
```

Example 12. Starting the CONNECT-TO Service Program

ND-30.025.02

## Page 47

# 3.3.1 The RECONNECT-TAD Command

If you want to fix a TAD without a PAD (Peripheral Access Device) or connect to a specific TAD, use:

```
RECONNECT-TAD <TAD logical unit no: >
<System name: >
```

For example, you want to fix TAD 774 on the system SOUTH:

```
C-T: SERVICE ↵
CONNECT-TO service-program - Version B.
CT-SERV: RECONNECT-TAD ↵
TAD LOGICAL UNIT NO: 774 ↵
SYSTEM-NAME: SOUTH ↵
Specify system-password for system: SOUTH please: (invisible) ↵
=== CONNECTION ESTABLISHED ===
T.A.D. LOGICAL UNIT NO: 774
LOCAL CHARACTER IS : 0 (ascii value)

<ESC>
14.13.30 16 MAY 1984
SINTRAN III - VSE ↵ SOUTH
ENTER FLOPPY-USER ↵
PASSWORD: (Invisible input) ↵
OK
SOUTH↵_
```

*Example 13. The RECONNECT-TAD Command*

You have now reconnected the TAD by using it yourself. This can be useful if, for some reason, you have a "TAD without a PAD", or if you want to resume executing something on a TAD that was disconnected.

This procedure may be used when you need to recover a resource that has been reserved when using the TAD.

### 3.3.2 The SET-TIMEOUT-VALUES Command

If you need to change timeout values for your system, use:

```
SET-TIMEOUT-VALUES <Not logged in: >
                   <Not active: >
```

The "not logged in" value applies when you have connected to a remote system, but have not logged in. The default value is one minute. The "not active" value you give determines how long you can remain inactive and logged in before COSMOS logs you out. Default here is 30 minutes.

|                   |                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| CT-SERV:          | SET-TIMEOUT-VALUES                |
| NOT LOGGED IN:    | 2                                 |
| NOT ACTIVE:       | 10                                |

**Example 14. The SET-TIMEOUT-VALUES Command**

You may change these values for everyone on your system who uses CONNECT-TO, but then you have to also give the DUMP-PROGRAM command. An example of how to go about it, is included later in this manual.

---

## Page 49

# COSMOS Operator Guide

## THE CONNECT-TO SERVICE PROGRAM AND THE OPERATION OF TAD'S

### 3.3.3 The TIMEOUT-OFF Command

This command can be used by user RT or user SYSTEM. It turns off your timeout, so you won't be disconnected once you connect to a remote system, no matter how long you are inactive.

This applies only until you are through using the CONNECT-TO program:

```
CT-SERV: TIMEOUT-OFF
```

#### Example 15. The TIMEOUT-OFF Command

This will prevent you from being disconnected due to either type of timeout. Note that ordinary time-sharing users are not allowed to use this command. You can find out whether TIMEOUT is ON or OFF by giving the C-T (not CT-SERV) command LIST-TIMEOUT-VALUES.

If you want to change these values for everyone on your system who uses CONNECT-TO, you have to give the DUMP-PROGRAM command too.

### 3.3.4 The TIMEOUT-ON Command

Use this to restore your timeout values to the default values for your system. Only users RT and SYSTEM may use this command:

```
CT-SERV: TIMEOUT-ON
```

#### Example 16. The TIMEOUT-ON Command

This is the default value for CONNECT-TO. You will thus normally use it to restore timeouts after TIMEOUT-OFF.

### 3.3.5 The SET-COMMAND-PROTECTION Command

SET-COMMAND-PROTECTION (Command: )  
<Protection (system, RT or public): >

Only user SYSTEM can use this command. You may define who may use a CONNECT-TO command. For instance, say you only want RT users to be able to dump script programs and you want to allow everyone to reconnect TAD's:

|                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| CT-SERV: SET-COMMAND-PROTECTION                         |
| COMMAND: INITIALIZE-SCRIPT                              |
| PROTECTION (SYSTEM, RT OR PUBLIC): RT                   |
| CT-SERV: SET-COMMAND-PROTECTION                         |
| COMMAND: RECONNECT-TAD                                  |
| PROTECTION (SYSTEM, RT OR PUBLIC): PUBLIC               |

Example 17. The SET-COMMAND-PROTECTION Command

These changes must be "dumped" to go into effect permanently.

ND-30.025.02

## Page 51

# 3.3.6 The DUMP-PROGRAM Command

When you use the DUMP-PROGRAM command, you dump the program which is in memory. By changing some values and then dumping, you can create a new version of CONNECT-TO that reflects your changes. We suggest that you do not dump to the file (UTILITY)COS-CONNECT-TO:PROG unless you have a copy of the original program.

```
@CONNECT-TO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COSMOS CONNECT-TO PROGRAM  VERSION - B , NOVEMBER 28, 1983
C-T: SERVICE
CONNECT-TO service-program - Version B.

CT-SERV: SET-COMMAND-PROTECTION 
COMMAND: INITIALIZE-SCRIPT
PROTECTION (SYSTEM, RT OR PUBLIC): RT 

CT-SERV: SET-COMMAND-PROTECTION 
COMMAND: RECONNECT-TAD 
PROTECTION (SYSTEM, RT OR PUBLIC): PUBLIC 

CT-SERV: SET-TIMEOUT-VALUES 
NOT LOGGED IN: 2 
NOT ACTIVE: 10 

CT-SERV: DUMP-PROGRAM 
PROG-FILE: "NEW-CONNECT-TO"

CT-SERV: EXIT 
C-T: EXIT 
Returning to: MAIN , as user: SYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 18. Modifying and Dumping the CONNECT-TO Program
```

Now, the next step is to make sure nobody is using CONNECT-TO and give the following command:

```
@DELETE-REENTRANT CONNECT-TO

@DUMP-PROGRAM-REENTRANT CONNECT-TO NEW-CONNECT-TO
```

When users on your system use CONNECT-TO, it will reflect the changes made above.

If you mistakenly give the above command while CONNECT-TO is in use, you will get the message "SEGMENT NUMBER 231 IS NOT CLEARED." (Note that it will not necessarily be segment 231.) Then you should use the RT-LOADER command CLEAR-SEGMENT to clear that segment.

ND-30.025.02

## Page 52

# COSMOS Operator Guide

## THE CONNECT-TO SERVICE PROGRAM AND THE OPERATION OF TAD'S

If this change is to be permanent, remember to change:

    @DUMP-PROGRAM-REENTRANT CONNECT-TO (UTILITY)COS-CONNECT-TO

to:

    @DUMP-PROGRAM-REENTRANT CONNECT-TO NEW-CONNECT-TO

in your DUMP-REENTRANT mode file. That will give you your new version of CONNECT-TO when you do a cold start.

The CONNECT-TO service command DUMP-PROGRAM is also used to dump script programs. That is explained in the chapter about SCRIPT.

## THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

### 4 THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

#### 4.1 Synopsis

This chapter explains the SCRIPT feature of the CONNECT-TO program, illustrating the different facilities with comprehensive examples.

Before reading this chapter, you should have thorough understanding of the CONNECT-TO program in general.

#### 4.2 An Introductory Example

SCRIPT is a feature of the CONNECT-TO subsystem that allows you to create your own versions of CONNECT-TO. For instance, if you often need to log in on a remote system and run a certain program there, you can create a special version of CONNECT-TO that does all that for you.

We will start by looking at an example of a SCRIPT, and then go on to explain in detail the different possibilities you have.

Let us say that you, or others on your system, often need to run a program called QUICK-ACCOUNT on the remote system SCHOLAR. In this example, we will make a SCRIPT called GO-QUICK. By writing @GO-QUICK in SINTRAN, you will automatically be connected to and logged in on SCHOLAR. QUICK-ACCOUNT will be executed. Upon completion, you return to SINTRAN on the local system.

Use PED to create a document called GO-QUICK:SYMB (use CAPITAL letters in the document) that contains the following lines:

```
*SCRIPT: /SINGLE/
  *INPUT: CONNECT-TO SCHOLAR
  *MACRO: LOGIN-DEFAULT,/MYSELF/,,FLOPPY-USER
  *DISPLAY-ON:
  *INPUT: QUICK-ACCOUNT
*ENDSCRIPT: /SINTRAN/
```

Example 19. A Simple Example of SCRIPT

SCRIPT signals the beginning of a SCRIPT, and ENDSCRIPT marks the end. A file may contain many SCRIPTS. /SINGLE/ means that this file only contains one SCRIPT. /SINTRAN/ means that the user of the SCRIPT will return to SINTRAN on her/his local system after the program QUICK-ACCOUNT has been run.

ND-30.025.02

## Page 57

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

The four lines starting with the line identifiers *INPUT:, *MACRO:, *DISPLAY-ON: and *INPUT: make up the SCRIPT body.

Note that each identifier in SCRIPT must start with an asterisk (*) and end with a colon (:). Extra blanks are stripped. It is not necessary to indent the SCRIPT body, but this will make your SCRIPT file much easier to read.

To create a SCRIPT out of the file above, do the following in SINTRAN:

```

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example 20. Initializing and Dumping a SCRIPT Program**

You will now have a file called GO-QUICK:PROG. To execute the SCRIPT, you write:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│ MAIN@GO-QUICK ⎯⎯⏎    │
└──────────────────────┘
```

**Example 21. Starting a SCRIPT Program**

You will automatically be connected to SCHOLAR, logged in as yourself (if that does not work, you will be logged in as FLOPPY-USER) and you will start the program called QUICK-ACCOUNT. When you are finished using QUICK-ACCOUNT, you will automatically be returned to your local system.

## Page 58

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

If you merely want to test a SCRIPT program, don't use the DUMP-PROGRAM command; exit to SINTRAN instead. Then write:

```
@GOTO-USER 0 ↵
```

Example 22. Testing a SCRIPT Program

If the SCRIPT programs you write are going to be used quite often, you may want to dump them as reentrant programs:

```
@DUMP-PROGRAM-REENTRANT GO-QUICK GO-QUICK:PROG ↵
```

Example 23. Dumping a SCRIPT Program Reentrant

You may want to include many SCRIPTs in the same SCRIPT program. That will reduce the number of :PROG files. For instance, the program SCRIPT:PROG could contain SCRIPTs for QUICK-ACCOUNT, FORTRAN-500, ND-500-MONITOR, etc., and the user would write:

```
@SCRIPT ND-500-MONITOR ↵
```

Example 24. Starting a Multi-SCRIPT Program

But use shorter SCRIPT names than these since they cannot be abbreviated by users.

## 4.4.1 *SCRIPT:

*SCRIPT: must be the first thing written in a SCRIPT file. A file must contain one *SCRIPT: identifier for each SCRIPT in the file. The identifier *SCRIPT: can be followed by one of three things:

1) If you have only one SCRIPT in the file, use:

    *SCRIPT: /SINGLE/

    If *SCRIPT: appears more than once in that file, you will get an error message when you try to initialize the SCRIPT.

---

## Page 60

# COSMOS Operator Guide  
## THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

2) If your SCRIPT file contains many SCRIPTs, use this for each of them:

**\*SCRIPT: (SCRIPT name)**

Note that the <SCRIPT name> is not enclosed in slashes (//). Each <SCRIPT name> must only appear once in the file. The name must be at least two characters long. Writing \*SCRIPT: PROG-ONE would be correct. Writing PROG ONE (no hyphen) would give you the name PROG; the rest of the line will be ignored.

3) The third possible parameter is to write:

**\*SCRIPT: /DEFAULT/**

This SCRIPT will be executed when no name is specified.

\*SCRIPT: must always be followed by a name. If the name is DEFAULT, it should be enclosed in slashes like this /DEFAULT/. The names you make yourself should not be enclosed in slashes.

### 4.4.2 \*ENDSCRIPT:

The identifier \*ENDSCRIPT: must come at the end of each SCRIPT in the SCRIPT file.

If \*ENDSCRIPT: has parameters, it means that the remote command mode is not allowed. When the SCRIPT comes this far, the user will be returned to her/his local system. S/he will be in SINTRAN if the parameter to \*ENDSCRIPT: is /SINTRAN/, otherwise the specified subsystem name will be started.

Do note that if the user is in a subsystem, for example, NOTIS-WP, the FORTRAN compiler, the ND-500-MONITOR, etc., the user will return to his/her local system immediately upon leaving that subsystem, but not before.

If the SCRIPT fails to connect to a remote system, the user will enter the CONNECT-TO program.

Let us take a closer look at the three possibilities for \*ENDSCRIPT:.

1) If you want the user of the SCRIPT to return to SINTRAN on his/her local system, use this:

**\*ENDSCRIPT: /SINTRAN/**

Writing /SINTRAN/ means that the remote command mode is not allowed.

---

## Page 61

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

2) If you want control to be returned to a specified subsystem on the local system, use this.

*ENDSCRIPT: `<subsystem name>`

The remote command mode is not allowed. Note that the subsystem name could be the name of a SCRIPT program.

For example, writing

*ENDSCRIPT: NOTIS-WP-ENG

will start up NOTIS-WP on the local system when the SCRIPT is finished.

3) The third possibility is to not write anything after ENDSCRIPT:

*ENDSCRIPT:

This means that the user will be where the SCRIPT left off on the remote system. That will normally mean that the user will be in SINTRAN or a subsystem on the remote system.

### 4.5 The SCRIPT Body

The body of a SCRIPT is the part between *SCRIPT: and *ENDSCRIPT:.

#### 4.5.1 *INPUT:

The identifier *INPUT: accepts a character string as its parameter:

*INPUT: `<character string>`

Any trailing spaces at the end of the string will be ignored. The `<character string>` will be input to the CONNECT-TO program if the user is not yet connected to a remote system. Otherwise, the string will be input to the remote system that the user is connected to.

ND-30.025.02

## Page 62

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

Here are a few examples:

| *INPUT: CONNECT-TO SCHOLAR          |
|-------------------------------------|
| *INPUT: LIST-SPOOLING-QUEUE PHILIPS,,|
| *INPUT: ACCESS                      |
| *INPUT: DATCL                       |
| *INPUT: FORTRAN-100                 |

Example 25. The *INPUT: Identifier

Here is one thing you should not write in a SCRIPT:

*INPUT: SERVICE

You may not have the SCRIPT enter the CONNECT-TO Service program before connecting to a remote system.

### 4.5.2 *ADDIN:

The *ADDIN: command has a <character string> as its parameter. Unused characters from the SINTRAN command line will be added to the string. *ADDIN: should only be used once after CONNECT-TO, because all unused characters will be added to the string.

*ADDIN: <character string>

If you want to create a SCRIPT that will allow users to connect to the system they specify, you can write:

*ADDIN: CONNECT-TO

When calling that SCRIPT, users can write the name of the system they want to connect to. For instance, if the SCRIPT is called TO, they can write:

@TO SCHOLAR

They will then be connected to the system called SCHOLAR.

# 4.5.3 *MACRO:

The command *MACRO: should be followed by one of the LOGIN macros or the ASK-SCRIPT macro. If the macro has any parameters, they should be given on the same line:

*MACRO: \<macro name\> \<macro parameters\>

There are the four *MACRO: possibilities, the first three have to do with logging in on the remote system:

1) If you want to log the SCRIPT user in as a specified user, do this:

```
LOGIN-SPECIFIED <user name> <password> <project password>
```

A LOGIN macro should only be used once in a SCRIPT.  
Example:

```
*ADDIN: CONNECT-TO
*MACRO: LOGIN-SPECIFIED TOM XYZ INVOICE
```

After the user is connected to the system s/he specifies, s/he will be logged in as TOM with the password XYZ and the project password INVOICE. Naturally, if that user is not defined on the specified system, or if one of the passwords is incorrect, the SCRIPT will be unable to log in the user.

2) LOGIN-DEFAULT has two possible parameters. If you use /MYSELF/, the SCRIPT will try to log in using the user's own name and password(s). If that fails, the SCRIPT will try again using the last 3 parameters. Note that \<user name\>, \<password\>, and \<project password\> are optional.

```
LOGIN-DEFAULT </myself/> <project password>
               <user name> <password> <project password>
```

Here are some examples:

```
*MACRO: LOGIN-DEFAULT /MYSELF/,,FLOPPY-USER
```

The SCRIPT will try to log the user in as her/himself. The two commas mean that the user has no project password. If the attempt to log in fails, FLOPPY-USER with no password and no project password will be tried.

```
*MACRO: LOGIN-DEFAULT /MYSELF/,,TOM XYZ INVOICE
```

If the SCRIPT cannot log in the user as her/himself, user TOM with password XYZ and project password INVOICE will be tried.

## Page 64

# COSMOS Operator Guide

## THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

3) The other possibility for LOGIN-DEFAULT is to enter User Environment:

LOGIN-DEFAULT /UE/

This should only be used if User Environment is enabled on all the TAD's.

Here is a SCRIPT file that logs in user TOM with password XYZ and project password INVOICE on SCHOLAR:

```
*SCRIPT: /DEFAULT/
*INPUT: CONNECT-TO SCHOLAR
*MACRO: LOGIN-DEFAULT /UE/
*INPUT: TOM
*INPUT: XYZ
*INPUT: INVOICE
*DISPLAY-ON:
*INPUT: CC
*ENDSCRIPT:
```

Example 26. Example of SCRIPT Using USER ENVIRONMENT

4) If you create a SCRIPT file that has no default SCRIPT, you will always be asked what SCRIPT name you want. If you want to replace that text with your own text, create a default SCRIPT that only has ASK-SCRIPT in its body:

```
*SCRIPT: /DEFAULT/
*MACRO: ASK-SCRIPT Please specify SCRIPT name:
*ENDSCRIPT:
```

Example 27. Example of ASK-SCRIPT

Don't use *MACRO: ASK-SCRIPT in a SCRIPT file with /SINGLE/ in it.

The character string must not be longer than 40 characters and it must only include printable characters. Each dollar sign ($) will produce a new line on output.

Note that the /DEFAULT/ SCRIPT with ASK-SCRIPT must only be used once in each SCRIPT file.

## Page 65

# COSMOS Operator Guide  
THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO  

## 4.5.4 *DISPLAY-ON:*

The command *DISPLAY-ON:* will display all the commands given in the SCRIPT and all responses from the system.

*DISPLAY-ON:*

All the commands given will be displayed. We recommend that you use *DISPLAY-ON: after the LOGIN macro.

## 4.5.5 *DISPLAY-OFF:*

To make a SCRIPT more transparent to the user, use the command:

*DISPLAY-OFF:*

Neither the commands given nor the system's responses will be displayed, so you will probably only want to use this before the connection has been made.

Display off is the default mode in a SCRIPT. You will normally want to include *DISPLAY-ON: after the log in.

## 4.6 Error Messages

The error messages that occur when you work with SCRIPTs will be explained in the following sections.

## 4.6.1 Errors When You Initialize SCRIPTs

When you use the INITIALIZE-SCRIPT command to initialize SCRIPT files, the error message will generally list the line number where the error was found:

INITIALIZE ERROR IN LINE: n

That message will be followed by one of the following messages:

Expected identifier: SCRIPT: found: xxxxxx

Check and make sure that your file has the same number of *ENDSCRIPT: and *SCRIPT: identifiers. If "found" contains many ampersands (they look like this: &&&) and other characters that you do not remember seeing in your SCRIPT file, you may have made a special sort of error: You may have edited your file in NOTIS-WP and given it a character size of 16 instead of 7. In that case, change 16 to 7 in NOTIS-WP menu 1.

ND-30.025.02

---

## Page 66

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

### ENDSCRIPT: is missing in SCRIPT: XXXXXX

You have more *SCRIPT: identifiers than *ENDSCRIPT: identifiers.

### More than one default SCRIPT defined

*SCRIPT: /DEFAULT/ must only appear once in a SCRIPT file.

### Several SCRIPTs in file are not allowed when /SINGLE/ is used

Change /SINGLE/ to /DEFAULT/ or to some name and you should be able to initialize your SCRIPT file.

### Unknown line identifier: "XXXXXXXX"

This means that your line does not begin with one of the following identifiers: *SCRIPT:, *ENDSCRIPT:, *INPUT:, *ADDIN:, *MACRO:, *DISPLAY-ON:, or *DISPLAY-OFF:. Only CAPITAL letters are accepted in the identifiers.

### Error in reading from SCRIPT file

This message will be followed by a SINTRAN file system error message which should explain what the problem is.

### Error in opening file, SINTRAN error message:

This will be followed by an error message such as "No such file name", "Ambiguous file name", etc., that should explain the error.

### End of file in SCRIPT: XXXXXX

The end of the file was reached before the definition of the SCRIPT XXXXXX was found. You have probably forgotten *ENDSCRIPT: or your file may be corrupted.

### Parameter error in: XXXXXX

The SCRIPT identifier XXXXXX has incorrect parameters. For instance, you may have written *SCRIPT:, followed by a one letter name, but SCRIPT names must be at least two letters long. This error message can also mean that the character string after ASK-SCRIPT was longer than 40 characters.

### Unknown macro: XXXXXX in SCRIPT: YYYYYY

The macro name XXXXXX found in the SCRIPT called YYYYYY is unknown. Make sure that you have spelled the macro name correctly, and that it is written with CAPITAL letters.

# COSMOS Operator Guide  
## THE SCRIPT FACILITY OF CONNECT-TO

### Parameter error in macro: XXXXXX "yyyyyy"

The parameters "yyyyyy" are incorrect. For instance, you may have misspelled /MYSELF/ after *MACRO:.

### 4.6.2 Errors When You Dump SCRIPTs

You may get the following messages when you dump a program:

**SCRIPTs already initialized and dumped**

If you have more SCRIPT files to initialize and dump, leave the CONNECT-TO program and return again. You may only initialize one SCRIPT file each time you enter the Service program.

**WARNING -- exit without dumping initialized SCRIPT.**

This means that you have left the Service program without having given the command DUMP-PROGRAM. You will not have created a :PROG file.

**WARNING -- program is dumped unmodified.**

If you enter the Service program, and dump without initializing, you will get this message. Remember to always initialize a SCRIPT file first.

### 4.6.3 Errors When You Run SCRIPTs

You may get the following message(s) when you run a program:

**Error in initialized commands:**

This will be followed by the type of error, for example, "Illegal command: <command name>." See if you used *INPUT: or *ADDIN: to send illegal input to the CONNECT-TO program.

**Unsuccessful log in on system: XXXXXX**

This probably means that the user name did not exist on the remote system or that the password given was incorrect.

**User Environment not active on TAD no. nnn on remote system: XXXXXX**

User SYSTEM needs to give the command @UE-AUTOMATIC-LOGIN for the TAD's on the remote system.

## 4.7 Examples

Here are some examples of SCRIPT files:

### 4.7.1 Example 1

If your users always use the ND 500 Monitor on the same system, you could make a SCRIPT file that looks like this:

```
*SCRIPT: /SINGLE/
  *ADDIN: CONNECT-TO MAXIM
  *MACRO: LOGIN-SPECIFIED GUEST XYZ PROG
  *DISPLAY-ON:
  *ADDIN: ND-500-MONITOR
*ENDSCRIPT: /SINTRAN/
```

*Example 28. Example of SCRIPT*

This file could be dumped as ND-500-MONITOR:PROG and here are some examples of how users would use it. Let us assume that N-500-M is an unambiguous abbreviation for the program:

| Command             | Description                                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| @N-500-M DEBUGGER   | This will enter the ND-500 Monitor on MAXIM and start the Debugger. |
| @N-500-M PLANC-500  | This will enter the ND-500 Monitor on MAXIM and start the PLANC compiler. |

ND-30.025.02

|                  |                    |
|------------------|--------------------|
| QN-500-M         |                    |
|                  | PLANC-500          |

Starts the program ND-500-MONITOR:PROG, which is based on the following SCRIPT file:

```
*SCRIPT: /SINGLE/
*INPUT: CONNECT-TO MAXIM
*MACRO: LOGIN-SPECIFIED GUEST XYZ PROG
*DISPLAY-ON:
*ADDIN: ND-500-MONITOR           PLANC-500
*ENDSCRIPT: /SINTRAN/
```

The rest of the input line goes to *ADDIN: after CONNECT-TO.

**Figure 8. Illustration of an Example of SCRIPT Syntax**

When the user leaves the ND-500-MONITOR, s/he will return to SINTRAN on his/her local system.

 *ADDIN: CONNECT-TO
 *MACRO: LOGIN-DEFAULT,,MYSELF,,FLUFFY-USER
 *DISPLAY-ON:
 *ADDIN: ND-500-MONITOR
*ENDSCRIPT: /SINTRAN/
```

**Example 29. Example of SCRIPT**

This file could be dumped as ND-500-MONITOR:PROG and here are some examples of how users would use it. Let us assume that N-500-M is a unambiguous abbreviation for the program:

| Command                        | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| @N-500-M ND-5019 DEBUGGER      | This will start the ND-500 Monitor on ND-5019 and start the Debugger. |
| @N-500-M MAXIM PLANC-500       | This will start the ND-500 Monitor on MAXIM and start the PLANC compiler. |

### 4.9 Executing a SCRIPT Program

Here is how the user can execute the program:

```
@FORTRAN-REMOTE

COSMOS CONNECT-TO PROGRAM VERSION - B , NOVEMBER 28, 1983  
CHOOSE F-100 OR FTN: F-100  
CONNECT-TO SYSTEM NAME: COMPACT  

Connected to: COMPACT, T.A.D.no: 772, as user: AUTHOR  
(Allowed idle time: 30 minutes)  
COMPACT@CC YOU WILL RETURN TO YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM AFTERWARDS  
COMPACT@FORTRAN-100  
ND-100/NORD-10 ANSI 77 FORTRAN COMPILER 203053D  
FTN: CC The user uses the compiler and exits when finished:  
FTN: EXIT

-- DISCONNECTED FROM: COMPACT --  
Returning to: CENTRAL , as user: AUTHOR  
CENTRAL@CC Note that the user returned to the local  
CENTRAL@CC system upon leaving the compiler.  
CENTRAL@_

```

Example 32. Example of Use of Multi-SCRIPT

The USER can, of course, give all the parameters on the command line in SINTRAN. We assume below that F-R is a sufficient abbreviation for FORTRAN-REMOTE:

| Command           | Description                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| @F-R F-100 COMPACT | This starts the FORTRAN-100 compiler on COMPACT.    |
| @F-R FTN SATELLITE | This starts the FTN compiler on SATELLITE.         |

## THE FILE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR

### 5 THE FILE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR

#### 5.1 Synopsis

The purpose of this chapter is to explain how to operate, start, maintain and stop, the COSMOS Remote File Access facility.

The reader is advised to read through the chapter about CONNECT-TO and the TAD'S.

#### 5.2 Remote File Access

There are about 30 SINTRAN commands that allow you to access files on remote computer systems. When you use one of them, as in the illustration below, a File Server must be running on the remote system.

| USER | TERMINAL | NORTH (LOCAL) | CENTRAL (REMOTE) |  
|------|----------|---------------|------------------|  
|      |          | ![FILE USER]  |                  |  
|      |          |               | SOUTH (REMOTE)   |  
|      |          |               | ![FILE SERVER]   |  

*Figure 10. A Typical Configuration*

Furthermore, your local system must have the File User. This means that the file COS-FA-USER-1:BPUN must be loaded on segment 22 and COS-FA-USER-2:BPUN must be loaded on segment 26. These files are stored under user UTILITY and you normally load them by running the mode file (UTILITY)COS-FA-USER-LOAD:MODE in your HENT-MODE file. This procedure is explained in the Product Description document for COSMOS.

ND-30.025.02

---

## Page 79

# COSMOS Operator Guide  
## THE FILE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR

If you want to see if a File Server is running on your system, give the command:

```
@TERMINAL-STATUS.....↓

```

**Example 33. Checking a File Server**

At least one of the lines should contain the underlined text below:

| 768 SYSTEM | HOLD | 0 | 2 | FS 01 ACTIVE |
|------------|------|---|---|--------------|

If you do not see "FS 01 ACTIVE" anywhere, you need to run the mode file `(UTILITY)COS-START-SERVER:MODE`. This mode file runs the File Server Administrator package to start a File Server. The package consists of the background program FS-ADMINISTRATOR and the RT program FSART which must be running on the system on which you want to control file servers.

### 5.3 The FS-ADMINISTRATOR Program

The program FS-ADMINISTRATOR allows you, the system supervisor, to start or stop File Servers on your local system or on other systems in your network. You must be logged in as user SYSTEM; then you write the following to start the program.

```
@FS-ADMINISTRATOR↓

```

**Example 34. Starting the FS-ADMINISTRATOR Program**

FS-ADMINISTRATOR accepts abbreviated commands just like SINTRAN does, and it prompts you for parameters that you don't specify on the command line.

You can give SINTRAN commands by typing @ within the FS-ADMINISTRATOR program, followed by the SINTRAN command you want.

The following sections describe all available commands and how to use them. The error messages from FS-ADMINISTRATOR are explained and other likely error messages are listed.

# 5.3.2 The SELECT-FSA Command

FSA: SELECT-FSA `<system name>`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`<system password>`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`<project password>`

You may select any system in the COSMOS network.

- `<System name>` is the name of the system on which you want to start File Servers.
- `<System password>` is the password of user SYSTEM on the specified system.
- You must give a `<project password>` if you want to start File Servers on a computer system that uses accounting.

If you do not specify a system name, it means your local system. Then you do not need to give the password because you already gave it when you logged in.

SELECT-FSA must be the first command you give: you select the system you want to control File Servers on. It establishes a connection between the FS-ADMINISTRATOR program and FSART on the system you specify. You then may control the File Servers that FSART administrates.

Here is how you select your own system:

| FSA: SELECT-FSA |  
| -------------- |  
| Connection established |  
| FSA: _ |  

### Example 36. The SELECT-FSA Command

The above example shows a successful connection. You will now be able to start or stop servers on your local system. Here are the most common error messages you may get if you fail to connect:

- **Remote FSA not started.**

  The RT program FSART is not running on the system you specified. If Remote File Access has been installed on that system, you probably need to run the mode file (UTILITY)COS-START-SERVER:MODE.

- **Wrong password.**

  You gave the wrong system password. Your request was refused.

- **Remote system is not available.**

  The specified remote system is not running, or XMSG is not started on the system.

- **Already selected.**

  You have already selected the FSART on that system.

- **Unknown remote system or remote FSA is not running**

  The system name is not known within the COSMOS network, or FSART is not activated on the specified system.

- **File Server Administrator already in use.**

  Another system supervisor has already selected FSART on the system you specified. Wait until the FSART is free to use.

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## THE FILE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR

If you do not get any message at all, it may mean that the RT program FSART has the wrong status. FSART should always be in RT Wait (RTWT) status. If it is not, connect to that system and do the following:

| @LIST-RT-DESCRIPTION FSART |
|----------------------------|
| **IN TIME QUEUE**          |
| | RTWT | RING:0 PRIORITY: 64 | |
| IF FSART is not in        |
| RTWT, do the              |
| following:                |
| | @ABORT_FSART |          |
| | @RT_FSART |             |

Example 37. Checking the RT Program FSART

### 5.3.3 The ND-100-MODE Command

FSA: ND-100-MODE

The File Server Administrator may operate in one of two modes. The ND-100-MODE is the default mode when you enter FS-ADMINISTRATOR.

### 5.3.4 The ND-500-MODE Command

FSA: ND-500-MODE

If you are on an ND-500 system, you may use this command to start a File Server on the ND-500 processor. However, this requires that you have the reentrant program FA-SERVER-500 on the specified system.

**NOTE:** As of 31.07.1984, FA-SERVER-500 is not available from ND. It will be made available at a later date.

## THE FILE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR

### 5.3.5 The START-SERVERS Command

FSA: START-SERVERS `<number of servers>`  
`<number of FAC's>`

We suggest you use the default values and start one server with 29 FAC's (File Access Connections). If you use 29, each File Server can access 29 files at the same time. This is one less than the maximum number of open files one background program can have.

Figure 12. The File Servers
```

Each system can have up to 4 File Servers. Each server can have up to 29 FAC's (File Access Connections). Each remote file a user accesses by using a SINTRAN command or monitor call uses one FAC on the remote system. It does not use a FAC on the local system.

FSART uses the Terminal Access Administrator (TADADM) to allocate one Terminal Access Device (TAD). That TAD is then used as a terminal on which to run the File Server. The TAD used by FSART cannot be used for remote log in. The TAD is released when the File Server on that TAD is stopped.

If too few TAD's or XMSG ports are free for FSART to use, you may not be able to start as many File Servers as you want. At any rate, you must have SINTRAN generated with at least as many TAD's as the maximum number of File Servers you wish to have running simultaneously.

ND-30.025.02

## Page 85

# Starting a Server with Maximum Number of FAC's

Here is how you start a server with the maximum number of FAC's:

```
FSA: START-SERVERS,1...
--- please wait ---
Server 1 started. No of FAC's attached: 29
FSA: @TERMINAL-STATUS,,,
LOG.NO  USER   MODE     CPU-MIN  OUT-OF  LAST-COMMAND

768     SYSTEM HOLD     0        0       FS 01 ACTIVE
670     SYSTEM COMMAND  0        3
FSA: @TADADM 
TAD NO RESERV ESCAP PORTNO - PORTNO TERMMO USER
768/ 0  TAD01 Enab 8 - 7 O **** File Server Adm
769/ 0  No    Enab Discon
770/ 0  No    Enab Discon
771/ 0  No    Enab Discon

FSA: 
```

Example 38. Starting a File Server

The `TERMINAL-STATUS` command shows that the Server is running on the TAD with logical device number 768, while the `TADADM` command shows that the File Server Administrator (i.e., FSART) has connected to TAD no. 768, which is used to run a File Server. Here are some error messages you may get:

- **System unavailable.**

  You cannot start a File Server before the system is set available.

- **Terminal access not running or unknown port name.**

  You must give the SINTRAN command START-TADADM before you can start servers.

- **No free TAD's at present, try later.**

  All available TAD's are in use by other servers or remote logged in users.

- **File Server aborted: out of XMSG resources, i.e., ports, task descriptors or message buffers.**

# 5.3.6 The Three Ways to Stop Servers

There are three ways to stop servers, each of them is illustrated in the following imaginary telephone conversations between the FS-ADMINISTRATOR and FSART:

## TERMINATE-SERVER:

| FS-ADMIN: | Do not open any more files and let me know when all your FAC's are closed. |
| --- | --- |
| FSART: | I got your message, but have open FAC's. |
| FSART: | All my FAC's are now closed. |
| FS-ADMIN: | I am going to hang up now, okay? |
| FSART: | Okay, goodbye. |
| FS-ADMIN: | Goodbye. (FS-ADMIN hangs up.) |

| | CONTROLLED STOP WHEN FACS ARE OPEN |
| --- | --- |

## ABORT-SERVER:

| FS-ADMIN: | I am going to hang up now, okay? (FS-ADMIN waits for FSART to say "bye".) |
| --- | --- |
| FSART: | Okay, goodbye. |
| FS-ADMIN: | Goodbye. (FS-ADMIN hangs up.) |

| | QUICK STOP |
| --- | --- |

## DISCONNECT-SERVER:

| FS-ADMIN: | Goodbye. (FS-ADMIN hangs up without waiting for FSART to say anything.) |
| --- | --- |

| | STOP IN ABNORMAL SITUATIONS |
| --- | --- |

Example 39. The Three Ways of Stopping a File Server

Note that FS-ADMIN disconnects immediately when you use DISCONNECT-SERVER.

## 5.3.6.1 The TERMINATE-SERVER Command

**FSA: TERMINATE-SERVER <server number>**

This command terminates the specified server. If the server has open File Access Connections (called FAC's), new FAC's will not be opened on the server, and when all the FAC's are finally closed, the server will stop and the TAD will be released. If the server has no open File Access Connections, it terminates immediately.

---

## Page 88

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## THE FILE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR

This command does not accept a default server number.

Examples:

```
The server has no open FAC's:
FSA: TERMINATE-SERVER 1  
Server 1 terminated.
FSA: 

The server has open FAC's:
FSA: TERMINATE-SERVER 2  
Server 2 terminating.
FSA: 
```

Example 40. The TERMINATE-SERVER Command

You may check the status of a File Server by using the command SERVER-STATUS.

### 5.3.6.2 The ABORT-SERVER Command

FSA: ABORT-SERVER `<server number>`

This command closes open files, disconnects any open FAC's and then stops the server immediately.

You can give this command if you cannot wait for a server to terminate.

```
FSA: TERMINATE-SERVER 1  
Server 1 terminating.

FSA: ABORT-SERVER 1  
Server 1 aborted
FSA: 
```

Example 41. The ABORT-SERVER Command

ND-30.025.02

---

## Page 89

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## THE FILE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR

### 5.3.6.3 The DISCONNECT-SERVER Command

FSA: DISCONNECT-SERVER <server number>

This command disconnects the connection from FSART to the specified File Server, which then terminates as soon as the disconnect message is received. Use this command if the command ABORT-SERVER does not terminate the server. In other words, this is a command for abnormal situations.

```
FSA: DISCONNECT-SERVER 1
Server 1 disconnected.

FSA:
```

*Example 42. The DISCONNECT-SERVER Command*

### 5.3.7 The LIST-SERVERS Command

FSA: LIST-SERVERS

This command lists each server and what state it is in:

```
FSA: LIST-SERVERS
Server 1 active.
Server 2 terminating.
Server 3 not accessible.
Server 4 not accessible.

FSA:
```

## Page 90

# COSMOS Operator Guide  
THE FILE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR

## 5.3.8 The SERVER-STATUS Command

FSA: SERVER-STATUS <server number>

This command obtains status information from the specified server. The default parameter value is all servers.

If the server is active, the number of reserved open file entries, the number of open files, the total number of attached File Access Connections, and the last user operation performed will be listed.

```
FSA: SERVER-STATUS.↵

| SERVER | STATE         | RESERVED ENTRIES | OPEN FILES | LAST USER OUT OF COMMAND |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| 1      | active        | 15               | 10         | 29                       | Open-file |
| 2      | terminating   | 2                | 2          | 29                       | Close-file |
| 3      | not accessible|                  |            |                          | 
| 4      | not accessible|                  |            |                          | 
```

Example 44. The SERVER-STATUS Command

## 5.3.9 The LIST-OPEN-FACS Command

FSA: LIST-OPEN-FACS <server number>

This lists the File Access Connections (FAC's) used by the server you specify. It also lists the name of the system, RT program, and the user that reserved the FAC. If the FAC has an open file, the file name is listed.

The server number must be 1, 2, 3 or 4.

### 5.3.10 The CLOSE-FAC Command

FSA: CLOSE-FAC `<server number>` `<connection ID>`

Server number is the number of the Server and connection ID is the number of the FAC.

This command closes and releases the specified File Access Connection. If the FAC has an open file, it is automatically closed.

The command enables you to clean up and release a FAC which is left open when the program reserving it has lost the connection due to some error.

## TRANSFER FILE

### 6.2.1 The CHECKOUT Command

This command checks to see if you can transfer files to the system you specify. In other words, you find out if XTRA is working on that system.

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
| F-T:CHECKOUT  ␍                                                |
| Remote system and user name: SOUTH(UTILITY)                |
| No of pages in file: 50  ␍                                     |
| To: ** Dummy (no access to file system) **                  |
| From: ** Dummy (no access to file system) **                |
|                                                           |
| Completed. Transfer rate: 15 Kbytes/sec                   |
|                                                           |
| F-T:                                                      |
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

*Example 48. The CHECKOUT Command*

In this case, file transfers to SOUTH are going fine. Some points to note:

- If you don't specify a user name, user SYSTEM will be used. That will only work if user SYSTEM on the system specified has the same password as SYSTEM on your local system. If you don't specify how many pages, 50 will be used.

- The peripheral file DUMMY must be defined on both systems. If it is not defined, you do so by typing:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
| @SET-PERIPHERAL-FILE  ␍                                      |
| FILE NAME: 'DUMMY'  ␍                                        |
| DEVICE NUMBER: Q  ␍                                         |
| @                                                         |
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

*Example 49. Creating the DUMMY: File*

If users on your system cannot transfer files between two systems, try using CHECKOUT for both systems to see if XTRA is working. If XTRA is not working, you should abort XTRA (@ABORT XTRA) on your local system, and then restart it by giving the SINTRAN command @RT XTRA. Check that no one else is using it. If this does not work, try the same procedure on the remote system.

# 6.2.2 The DEFINE-TRANSFER-CONDITIONS Command

The command DEFINE-TRANSFER-CONDITIONS may be worthwhile using if you are transferring files on a wide area network (WAN), using the COSMOS X.21 Option or the COSMOS X.25 Option. For example:

```
F-T: DEFINE-TRANSFER-CONDITIONS 
NUMBER OF BUFFERS: 2 
SIZE IN BYTES: 512 
SECURE MESSAGES?: YES 
F-T: TRANSFER (etc.)
```

Example 50. The DEFINE-TRANSFER-CONDITIONS Command

This may work better than using two 1024-byte buffers, which is the default value.

# 6.2.3 Other Commands

Some of the less important commands and self-explanatory commands are covered here:

APPEND-REMOTE-BATCH is explained in the COSMOS User Guide. Note that if users make mistakes, their batches won't start and the error message will appear on the remote computer system's console. For instance, if a user specifies an output file that doesn't exist, that error is discovered when it is time to execute the batch and the following message appears on the remote console:

```
17.49.36 ERROR 08 IN BCHO3; BATCH SYSTEM ERROR
FILE ERROR NO.: 56; ADDRESS: 27510
NO SUCH FILE NAME
```

Example 51. Example of Batch Error Message

GET-ERROR-MESSAGE {Error value} gives you the text that corresponds to the numerical error code you specify. This works for all the XMSG errors, but not for SINTRAN errors.

HELP {Command name} lists the matching command(s) and their parameters. Note that HELP does not list some commands that end users never need to use.

---

## Page 100

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## TRANSFER FILE

**EXIT** returns you to SINTRAN.

**LIST-ALL-COMMANDS** lists all the commands, including those end users do not need.

**LIST-NAMES** `<system name or no.>` lists all the names that are defined on the system you specify. This is the same as the LIST-NAMES command in the XMSG command program.

You will probably not need to use the following five commands:

- **DECODE-BUFFER** `<Input buffer (y/n)>`
- **DEBUGPRINT-ON**
- **DEBUGPRINT-OFF**
- **LIST-VARIABLES**
- **MODE** `<File name>, <No. of times>`

Writing DECODE-BUFFER YES gives you the File Transfer program's input buffer, while DECODE-BUFFER NO gives its output buffer.

DEBUGPRINT-ON can be used to list registers when calling XMSG. DEBUGPRINT-OFF stops debug information from being written each time you use a command. Default is debug information off.

LIST-VARIABLES lists some the variables that XMSG gets from File Transfer. This is only of interest to XMSG programmers.

MODE executes the mode file you specify as many times as you want. Writing MODE EX 3 is the same as typing @MODE EX:SYMB three times in SINTRAN.

# Chapter 8: Memory Management

## Overview

Memory management is a crucial aspect of system performance and reliability. In this chapter, we will explore techniques for effective memory allocation and deallocation, and methods to prevent common issues such as memory leaks and fragmentation.

## Techniques

### 1. Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamic memory allocation involves managing memory during runtime. Functions such as `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` in C can be used for this purpose.

### 2. Garbage Collection

Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use by the application. This can reduce the occurrence of memory leaks but may introduce overhead.

## Best Practices

- Avoid using global variables for temporary data storage.
- Regularly check for memory leaks using tools like Valgrind.
- Implement proper error handling for allocation failures.

## Use Cases

| Function    | Description                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| `malloc`    | Allocates a block of memory        |
| `calloc`    | Allocates and initializes memory   |
| `free`      | Deallocates previously allocated memory |

Efficient memory management is essential for the stability and performance of applications. By adhering to the best practices outlined in this chapter, developers can build systems that effectively utilize available resources.

### 7 REMOTE SPOOLING

#### 7.1 Synopsis

This chapter covers the system supervisor part of the Remote Spooling facility of COSMOS.

Since this system uses parts of the TRANSFER-FILE subsystem, the reader should have a general understanding of that subsystem.

#### 7.2 The Purpose of Remote Spooling

COSMOS Spooling provides you with considerable flexibility. You make a list of local printer **names** that you use when you want to print documents. These names represent printers on local or remote computer systems.

Users on your system need only learn the names you define. When they print a document in NOTIS or other applications programs, it is copied to a spooling file which is put in the COSMOS Spooling Queue. The spooling file is then sent to the spooling queue of the printer they specified.

The figure on the next page illustrates the structure of the COSMOS Remote Spooling system.

**SPRTn** is an RT program that sends spooling files to a printer. The "n" in "SPRTn" is a number. Each printer has its own SPRTn.

***XFTRA*** is the RT program that transfers files between systems.

By using spooling queues twice, once for files waiting to be transferred to (remote) printers, and once for each printer where the transferred files are waiting to be printed, the waiting time for users is reduced to a minimum.

## 7.3 The COSMOS Spooling Service Program

The COS-SPOOL-SERVIC program is the main tool for the system operator when configuring a remote spooling service. We recommend you store it under user UTILITY.

Here is how you start it and list all the commands at your disposal:

```
@(UTILITY)COS-SPOOL-SERVIC↵
COSMOS Spooling Service program (version B) of 1983.11.11 11:00

C-S-S:LIST-ALL-COMMANDS↵

We arranged the commands in alphabetical order for this manual.

ND-30.025.02

## Page 107

# 7.3.1 The Command LIST-PRINTERS

The first command you want to use is LIST-PRINTERS to see what printers are already defined:

| Local printer name:  | Remote system and printer name: | Header: |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------|
| DP-55                | MAIN.DP-55                      |         |
| PHILIPS-T            | MAIN.PHILIPS                    |         |
| PHILIPS-S            | SCHOLAR.PHILIPS                 | X       |
| LINE-PRINTER         | SCHOLAR.LINE-PRINTER            | X       |
| (Default printer)    | MAIN.LINE-PRINTER               |         |

C-S-S: _

*Example 53. The LIST-PRINTERS Command*

# 7.3.2 The DEFINE-PRINTER Command

Let us say that you define a printer called NICE-PRINTER. Here is what you do:

```
C-S-S: DEFINE-PRINTER ↵
Local spooling file name? NICE-PRINTER ↵
Remote system name? SOUTH ↵
Remote printer name? PHILIPS ↵
Extra header (Y/N)? YES ↵
No. of local spooling files? 2 ↵
OK

C-S-S: _
```

*Example 54. The DEFINE-PRINTER Command*

You have now created two spooling files on your system. Their names are (SYSTEM)NICE-PRINTER:1 and (SYSTEM)NICE-PRINTER:2. When files are copied to NICE-PRINTER, they will now be printed on the PHILIPS printer on the computer system SOUTH.

ND-30.025.02

---

## Page 108

# COSMOS Operator Guide  
## REMOTE SPOOLING

Now you can see that your printer has been defined in the table:

| Local printer name | Remote system and printer name | Header |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| DP-55              | MAIN.DP-55                     |        |
| PHILIPS-T          | MAIN.PHILIPS                   |        |
| PHILIPS-S          | SCHOLAR.PHILIPS                | X      |
| LINE-PRINTER       | SCHOLAR.LINE-PRINTER           | X      |
| NICE-PRINTER       | SOUTH.PHILIPS                  | X      |
| (default printer)  | MAIN.LINE-PRINTER              |        |

C-S-S:

### Example 55. Checking That a Printer is Defined

If you want to redefine a printer, use DELETE-PRINTER and then DEFINE-PRINTER.

You now have a file called NICE-PRINTER:

```
@FILE-STATISTICS NICE-PRINTER,,,
FILE 18 : (PACK-ONE-655:SYSTEM)NICE-PRINTER:;1
(SPOOLING FILE)
(etc.)
```

### Example 56. Checking the Local Spooling Files

ND-30.025.02

---

## Page 109

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## REMOTE SPOOLING

If users on your system will be writing to this printer from NOTIS-WP or PED, you should define it in the file (SYSTEM)WP-PRINTERS. Here are eight lines of that file (note that only the first 65 characters of each line are shown):

| Logical name   | Computer.File name   | Printer type |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| LINE-PRINTER   | SCHOLAR.LINE-PRINTER | LINE-PRINTER |
| EPSON          | TERMINAL             | EPSON-MX80   |
| NICE-PRINTER   | NICE-PRINTER         | PHILIPS      |

This should be the name of a spooling file on your local system. If you use the name of a file on a remote system, for example, COMPACT.LINE-PRINTER, the files printed on it will be sent to the remote system without using COSMOS Spooling.

This is the name that users in NOTIS-WP, NOTIS-TF and PED use after they push the PRINT key. It need not have the same name as "computer.file name", but that is normally the easiest way to do it.

*Figure 15. The WP-PRINTER:SYMB File*

To fill in all the attributes of a printer (feeder, form length, displacement, etc.), see the WP-PRINTERS file on the system that the printer is on.

### 7.3.3 The DELETE-PRINTER Command

If you want to remove a printer from the list, use the command DELETE-PRINTER:

```
C-S-S: DELETE-PRINTER  
Local printer name? NICE-PRINTER  
OK

C-S-S:
```

*Example 57. The DELETE-PRINTER Command*

NICE-PRINTER will disappear from the list of printers and the files NICE-PRINTER:;1, NICE-PRINTER:;2, etc., will be deleted.

### 7.3.4 The CHANGE-PASSWORD Command

COSMOS Spooling needs to be able to know FLOPPY-USER's password on the remote systems listed under LIST-PRINTERS. It assumes that FLOPPY-USER has no password unless you tell it otherwise. If FLOPPY-USER has a password on a remote system, users will fail when they try to transfer their files to that printer; they will get SINTRAN error message 48D (Wrong password).

If you know that user FLOPPY-USER has the password XYZ on the system SOUTH, you can remedy that problem as follows:

```
C-S-S: CHANGE-PASSWORD  
Remote system name? SOUTH  
Password? (Write XYZ, it will be invisible)  
OK

C-S-S:
```

*Example 58. The CHANGE-PASSWORD Command*

If you don't know FLOPPY-USER's password on SOUTH, you can't access printers on SOUTH.

ND-30.025.02

## Page 111

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## REMOTE SPOOLING

### 7.3.5 Other Commands

GET-FILE-STATISTICS tells how many pages and bytes the last file transferred had.

LIST-SERVER-ERRORS lists the transfers COSMOS Spooling was unable to perform. The number of the error message is given. You can find out what the error message was by using the command GET-ERROR-MESSAGE \<Error value (dec)\>. This works for all the XMSG errors, but not for SINTRAN errors.

HELP \<Command name\> lists the matching command(s) and their parameters. Note that HELP does not list some commands that end users never need to use. See LIST-ALL-COMMANDS below.

EXIT returns you to SINTRAN.

LIST-ALL-COMMANDS lists all the commands, including those end users do not need.

LIST-NAMES \<system name or no.\> lists all the names that are defined on the system you specify. This is the same as the LIST-NAMES command in the XMSG command program.

MODE \<File name\>,\<No. of times\> executes the specified mode file as many times as you want.

You will not need to use the following three commands:

- DECODE-BUFFER \<Input buffer (y/n)\>
- DEBUGPRINT-ON
- DEBUGPRINT-OFF

Writing DECODE-BUFFER YES gives you the COSMOS Spooling program's input buffer, while DECODE-BUFFER NO gives its output buffer.

DEBUGPRINT-ON can be used to list registers when calling XMSG. DEBUGPRINT-OFF stops debug information from being written each time you use a command.

### 7.4 The Mode File COS-DEFINE-PRINT:MODE

Store the mode file COS-DEFINE-PRINT:MODE under user UTILITY. You should include this file in (SYSTEM)LOAD-MODE:MODE, so that it will be executed every time you do a warm start.

In COS-DEFINE-PRINT:MODE, you should define all the printers you normally use, and you should use CHANGE-PASSWORD for any remote systems that have passwords for FLOPPY-USER. You will only need to use these two commands in COS-DEFINE-PRINT.

ND-30.025.02

---

## Page 112

# COSMOS Operator Guide

## REMOTE SPOOLING

### 7.5 Warm Starts

You should have the following two commands in your LOAD-MODE file:

```
@START-SPOOLING COSMOS-SPOOLING
@MODE (UTILITY)COS-DEFINE-PRINT:MODE,,,
```

Example 59. The Remote Spooling Commands in the SINTRAN LOAD-MODE File

Then these commands will be executed every time you do a warm start.

### 7.6 Cold Starts

You should have the following command in your HENT-MODE file:

```
@MODE (UTILITY)COS-LOAD-COSPO:MODE,,,
```

Example 60. Loading COSMOS Spooling from the SINTRAN HENT-MODE File

Then this mode file will be executed every time you do a warm start.

## HANDLING OF XMSG ERRORS

### 8 HANDLING OF XMSG ERRORS

#### 8.1 Synopsis

This chapter gives a brief outline of how to operate XMSG, with special consideration of how to diagnose error conditions.

#### 8.2 XMSG Troubleshooting

The following sections list some of the most 'common' error conditions that can occur when using XMSG.

##### 8.2.1 Problems When Generating XMSG

Check that the highest address used in POF (5XEND - see end of generation listing) is less than 176000B and that there are no undefined symbols.

##### 8.2.2 Problems When Loading XMSG

When loading segment 33 (XMSG POF area), the RT-loader can give the message 'VIRTUAL ADDRESS AREA FILLED SEGMENT 33'. If this occurs, contact your local ND service representative.

##### 8.2.3 Problems When Starting/Running XMSG

1. The error message 'XMSG NOT LOADED' implies that the XMSG-LOAD:MODE file has not been run correctly. Check the output file.

2. Error message 28: 'Space not available' for segment 33 implies that XMSG was unable to fix its POF part into memory because someone else had stolen it. The reason for this might be that XMSG was started after spooling or the ND-500 monitor was started. Edit the SINTRAN III LOAD-MODE:SYMB file so that XMSG is started before spooling and the ND-500 monitor, then restart the system.

ND-30.025.02

## Page 117

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## HANDLING OF XMSG ERRORS

3) If If XROUT aborts with user error 53, the suberror code gives the reason:

   | Code | Description |
   |------|-------------|
   | 1    | (probably) The POF area (segment 33) was too big (above 176000B). |
   | 9    | There was not enough physical memory to fix segment 35 (order more memory). |

   Other errors: Report back to your local ND service representative.

4) XROUT may also abort with error code 54. Report back to your local ND service representative.

## 8.2.4 If the Computer Stops or Loops

1) ERRFATAL when restarting the system after loading XMSG  
   This is probably due to the SINTRAN III startup sequence running out of space in POF. A smaller SINTRAN III must be generated (or a smaller XMSG). To recover either do a `)HENT` or use MACM to patch location 165 to 0 and then restart SINTRAN III by using 22!.

2) At any other time  
   XMSG itself does not call ERRFATAL (it crashes itself - see below). If a crash occurs follow the usual sequence for finding out what was going on (look at active levels, and registers for that level, etc......).

3) When XMSG crashes itself  
   A message will be printed out on the error device 'XMSG FATAL ERROR: xxxx'. In this case XMSG has noticed that its internal tables have been corrupted, or the information being sent to it by another computer is untreatable. In this case the crash reason (a value to be matched with the XMSG crash codes xxxx in XMSGH-VALUES) and the crash location in POF are written out together with the error message. They are also saved in the XMSG basefield locations XCRAR (reason) and XCRAP (location).

   If this occurs, you should look in the listing to see where ZCRAS (XMSG's ERRFATAL) was called, and see why - usually there is an explanatory text there. The information to be collected is:

   - the registers on level 5

ND-30.025.02

---

## Page 118

# COSMOS Operator Guide
## HANDLING OF XMSG ERRORS

- the XMSG basefield (200B locations)
- the current caller's XT-block (pointed at by XCTPT in the basefield)

It is difficult to say in general which other locations are interesting, as it is dependent on where the crash routines were called. If the crash reason was XXR02, then the reason that XMSG crashed was that XROUT crashed, and one should dump the XROUT basefield that lies at the beginning of segment 34.

Note that this should be done without stopping SINTRAN and so the SINTRAN-SERVICE command OCTAL-DUMP can be used to dump large areas of segment 33 and 35 to a disk file.

After you have tried to find out what has happened, XMSG should be stopped and restarted in the usual way.

### 8.3 If Inter System XMSG Does Not Work

If XMSG runs, but IS-XMSG does not provide communication, the following diagnostic steps might prove useful.

1. Log in as user SYSTEM

2. Recover XMSG-COMMAND program (UTILITY) and execute the command LIST-LINKS. Find the link, and note the Logical Unit (LUN), you should be using. Possible states are:

   | Status | Description |
   |--------|-------------|
   | DEAD | Fatal hardware error, see HDLC status |
   | CALL | Trying to make contact with remote system, but there is no reply. Either the remote system has not done START-LINK, do LIST-LINKS there to check, or there is a hardware malfunction, use XMSG-HDLC-TEST (described below) to find it. |
   | CONN | Your end has received a restart indication from the opposite end, but has not received an acknowledgement of your restart. Try STOP-LINK and START-LINK at each end. If this does not cure the problem, then the link is probably only functioning in one direction. Use XMSG-HDLC-TEST to check link hardware. |
   | RUN | Full duplex contact has been established. If all is not OK, go on to the next diagnostic. |

3. Execute the command LIST-ROUTE.  
   The command lists all the systems via which you must go in order to reach the destination. Each system is contacted, so LIST-ROUTE will indicate how far you can go before the error occurs. Go to the system in error and: 

ND-30.025.02

---

## Page 119

# COSMOS Operator Guide

## HANDLING OF XMSG ERRORS

- Check that XMSG is running

- Check that the links are running (see LIST-LINKS above)

- Check that the routing information in that system is correct (using LIST-ROUTES)

If you can reach the target system, and CONNECT-TO or TRANSFER-FILE do not run, then use:  
LIST-NAMES \<target system name\>  
If you get an error message, then first check that the remote system name is known locally **and remotely**. If not, use DEFINE-SYSTEM-NAME to define system name.

The names that are listed should include:

| Name   | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| *TADMIN | if remote terminal access is running. Use the SINTRAN command START-TADADM if not. |
| *XFTRA  | if file transfer server is running. Use the SINTRAN commands ABORT XFTRA and RT XFTRA if not. |

### 8.4 Short Guide for XMSG-HDLC-TEST Program

#### 8.4.1 Purpose

The XMSG-HDLC-TEST program is used to test the HDLC and the MEGALINK interfaces and cables which are to be used by XMSG, since XMSG itself does not include detailed diagnostics.

#### 8.4.2 Before Running XMSG-HDLC-TEST

Since XMSG-HDLC-TEST uses the normal HDLC driver in SINTRAN, and requires buffer space, the latter must be allocated to it. The example assumes that HDLC2 is to be tested. If another link is being tested, replace 1362 and 1363, with n, n+1.

```
@SINTRAN-SERVICE ⏎
*CHANGE-BUFFER-SIZE,1362,L,400,Y,N ⏎
*CHANGE-BUFFER-SIZE,1363,0,400,Y,N ⏎
*EXIT ⏎
@RESTART-SYSTEM ⏎
```

Example 61. Changing the HDLC Buffer Size

The reason why you have to do a RESTART-SYSTEM, a warm start, is to allow SINTRAN to reallocate the buffers.

### 8.4.3 Instructions for Running XMSG-HDLC-TEST

```
@(UTIL)XMSG-HDLC-TEST

HDLC / MEGALINK Test Program (1.xx) ** (When ....

Sintran Log.Unit..... (def=1360): 1362

Loop on interface? (N/y): Y
Max frame size (dec. ) bytes (def=128): CR (default)

>SEND 2000
```

**Example 62. Running the XMSG-HDLC-TEST Program**

The test program will now put the interface into maintenance mode and send and receive 2000 frames in local loop, checking the data that is received. If this goes OK, the driver and interface on the local system are OK.

Try this also at the other end (including the change of buffer size) and (if OK) then put that end into echo-mode by restarting XMSG-HDLC-TEST and replying N to the question 'Loop on interface?' and then using the ECHO-MODE command.

Go back to the first system, restart XMSG-HDLC-TEST and reply N to the 'Loop on interface?' command. The SEND command then transmits frames to the remote system, which echoes them, and the local system checks that the replies are correct. If both the local loop tests worked correctly, but the last test failed, the problem lies in the plugs, cables or switch settings. In particular, check that the cable type is correct for the interface (MEGALINKS and HDLC's use DIFFERENT cables!).

**WARNING**: XMSG-HDLC-TEST does not release the devices when exiting, so log out after running XMSG-HDLC-TEST, and before using the START-LINK command in XMSG-COMMAND.

| 1   | \<XROUT system\>        | \<local system\> |
| 2   | \<Port or system name\> |                 |
| 3   | \<system number\>       |                 |

#### Rules

Only permitted for user SYSTEM. XROUT system must be local.

#### Related Commands

LIST-NAMES

#### Function

This command defines a remote system name in the local system tables. You must also use this command to define additional symbolic names for your local system.

To delete a name entry in the local XMSG name tables, you just give the system name and answer the third parameter, \<system number\>, with carriage return (CR).

| 3   | `<via system>`  |                        |

**Rules**: Only permitted for user SYSTEM. The XROUT system must be the local (default) system. The names of the different systems must be defined in the local name tables.

**Related Commands**: LIST-ROUTING-INFO

**Function**: This command updates the **local** system routing tables.

**EXPLANATION**: In the example above, the `<via system>` parameter may be any system on the route to the specified `<system>`. The routing to (and name of) the `<via system>` parameter must be known by your local system. The name of the target system must also be defined in your own system tables. It is not necessary to define the route to an adjacent system.

### Command Name: LIST-LINKS

| No: | Parameter Name:      | Default Value: |
|-----|----------------------|----------------|
| 1   | `<link block address>` | `{all links}`  |

**Rules:** Only permitted for user SYSTEM.

**Related Commands:**
- START-LINK
- STOP-LINK
- START-NETWORK-SERVER
- STOP-NETWORK-SERVER

**Function:** This command is used to list the current status of all links being used by XMSG. This means those started by the START-LINK or the START-NETWORK-SERVER commands. You may specify either XMSG link index or link block address.

A link reserved by a network server is a _virtual link_. The System Identification (Sysid) then refers to a virtual system within the local system and Sysid will be in the range of 9800 to 9803. Further, the figure in the LUN column is the XMSG Port number and not the SINTRAN Logical Unit Number. The columns giving HDLC information (Rcv, Xmit, Hard stat) will always be zero.

## Command name: LIST-NAMES

| No: | Parameter Name:  | Default Value:           |
|-----|------------------|--------------------------|
| 1   | `<XROUT system>` | `<local XROUT system>`   |

**Rules:** Available to all users.

**Related Commands:** LIST-SYSTEMS

**Function:** This command asks an XROUT system to dump out its name table, listing the system, port number and number of free service points for each name in XROUT's tables.

In an inter-system configuration, the command allows access to any XROUT, so the first prompt asks for the system number where the XROUT program is to be found. (Default is local.)

**EXPLANATION:** The output parameters of this command are:

- **System** - System number
- **Port** - XMSG port number
- **Free SPs** - Number of free XMSG Service Points
- **Name** - Remote system or port name

It is not possible to specify a virtual system.

### Command name : LIST-ROUTING-INFO

| No. | Parameter Name     | Default Value      |
|-----|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1   | \<from system>     | \<local system>    |
| 2   | \<to system>       | \<all systems>     |

Rules: Available to all user categories.

Related Commands: 
- DEFINE-SYSTEM-ROUTE
- REMOVE-SYSTEM-ROUTE

### Function

This command lists the routing tables and checks the connections. The parameters \<from system> and \<to system> are both of type 'system' which means that 'system number' or 'system name' may be specified.

The command checks the network by sending connection requests to the remote with system(s). It is advisable to identify the name of the \<to system> if you have a lot of connections through a WAN. This is because of the fact that a public data network may be congested, so it may take minutes to get a complete list.

### EXPLANATION: Output parameters

- **Path according to local tables**: this is how the route is defined on the system given in the \<from system> input parameter.
  
- **Path according to tables**: this is how the route is defined on the system specified in the input parameter \<via system> of the command DEFINE-SYSTEM-ROUTE and the following systems (if any).

- **Actual path**: the actual path of the connection. The 'actual path' and 'path according to tables' should be the same. All systems on the route to the target system will be listed here.

| Command name: LIST-SYSTEMS |
|---------------------------|

| No: | Parameter Name: | Default Value: |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| 1   | `<system>`      | `<all systems>`|

Rules: Only permitted for user system if XMSG is older than version H.

Related Commands:  
LIST-NAMES  
LIST-ROUTING  

Function: Lists the system(s) that are defined in the local system's tables.

### EXPLANATION:
Description of the information listed

- **Address**: Address of system block descriptor
- **Sysno**: System Number identifier
- **State**: >0 if connected, if <0, timeout while waiting for INIT
- **Link**: Address of link block descriptor
- **Subaddr**: Parameter to Network Server to find the way
- **Send-seq-recv**: Send and receive sequence numbers for secure messages
- **Hops**: Number of LANs and WAN hops to this system (if state>0)

If the link is a virtual link to a network server, Sysno and Subaddr will display the same system number. This is because Sysno and Subaddr then identify a virtual system within the local system.

| No:          | Parameter Name:          | Default Value: |
| 1            | <ASCII value>            |                |

Rules: Available to all users. This is a SERVICE command.

Related Commands: LIST-LOCAL-CHARACTER

Function: The value of the local character when the system is installed is 0, which corresponds to CTRL @ on the standard NOTIS terminal.

**EXPLANATION:** This command changes the local (recall) character. If a permanent change is necessary, see the command DUMP-PROGRAM.

Command name : **CONNECT-TO**

| No: | Parameter Name: | Default Value:   |
|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| 1   | \<system name\> | \<local system\> |

Rules: Available to all users.

Function: This command connects you to the remote system specified.

### EXPLANATION: 

If no system is specified when recovering the program from SINTRAN, the program is started as a normal program and you may use any of the other commands in the program.

If the system name is specified, the connection will be established directly. If you specify the default system, giving commas or answering the prompt System name with carriage return, you will be connected to your local system.

Make sure that you know the **local character** before you connect to another system.

| Command name: DUMP-PROGRAM |
|---|---|---|
| No: | Parameter Name: | Default Value: |
| 1 | `<prog-file>` | |

Rules: Available to all users. This is a SERVICE command.

Related Commands:  
INITIALIZE-SCRIPT  
SET-TIMEOUT-VALUES  
TIMEOUT-OFF  
TIMEOUT-ON  

Function: This command dumps the modified program code in memory to the specified prog file.

### EXPLANATION:
This command is used when you want to create a new version of the CONNECT-TO program. Normally there are two reasons why you want to create a new version of the CONNECT-TO program:

1. You have created a SCRIPT you want to dump as a separate program
2. You have modified the system default values of certain parameters, such as the timeout values or the command protection, and you want the changes to be permanent.

You should make certain that you do not dump onto the file (UTILITY)COS-CONNECT-TO:PROG because this is the standard version.

When the program has been dumped, you may dump it reentrant, using the SINTRAN command DUMP-PROGRAM-REENTRANT.

# 5. File Recovery

## Recovery Procedures

If an update needs to be restarted, the operator shall use the following steps:

## 5.1 Command File

- Use the function on the menu 1 screen, selection 5, to resequence the following control logs as follows:
  - EXT
  - DLOG
  - SDSM
  - ARCH

- Selection 7 resets the profile log and the network bandwidth log.

## 5.2 Recycle Process

Begin the recycle process using menu 1, selection 3. This will reset specific job classes, thus ensuring no discrepancies.

## Table Definitions

| Abort Option | Command Description   |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| 1            | Abort and restart     |
| 2            | Continue without abort|
| 3            | Special handling reqd |

**Note:** Always verify the sequence before proceeding to avoid erroneous data loss.

## Post-Recovery Validation

1. Confirm the system logs for any unresolved discrepancies.
2. Ensure job classes have reset correctly.
3. System fumes should be verified.

## Summary

The recovery process ensures integrity and consistency of the updates and restores balance in the workflow.
