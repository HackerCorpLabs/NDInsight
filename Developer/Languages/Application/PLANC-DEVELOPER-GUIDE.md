## Installing PLANC

PLANC for ND-100 is product `ND-10309`. Three versions are catalogued — pick whichever floppy you
have:

- [ND-10309A](../../../Installation/Software/ND-10309/ND-10309A/README.md) (82.02.19) and
  [ND-10309B](../../../Installation/Software/ND-10309/ND-10309B/README.md) (82.06.15) — verified
  from their PD sheets, ship as `:BPUN` (`@DUMP-REENTRANT PLANC-100,0,1,<file>`).
- [ND-10309F](../../../Installation/Software/ND-10309/ND-10309F/README.md) (floppy
  `10309F00-1S`) — no PD sheet located; ships pre-linked as `:PROG`, procedure adapted from A/B
  and not independently verified.

All versions need a 126K/128K-word terminal background segment
(`@CHANGE-BACKGROUND-SEGMENT-SIZE`) and cannot be restarted with `@CONTINUE`. See
[ND-10309 — PLANC for ND-100](../../../Installation/Software/ND-10309/README.md) for the full
product overview.

## Quick Start

**See [QUICK-START-EXAMPLES.md](../../QUICK-START-EXAMPLES.md) Section 4 for complete Hello World example.**

### Minimal Example

**File:** `HELLO:PLNC` (must have CRLF line endings and even parity)

Source files use type `:PLNC` or `:SYMB`. The compiler looks for `:SYMB` first, then `:PLNC`.

```planc
MODULE hello
    INTEGER ARRAY : stack(0:100)
    BYTES : msg := 'HELLO FROM PLANC!'

    PROGRAM : main
        INISTACK stack
        OUTPUT (1,'AL17',msg)
        OUTPUT (1,'AL1','$')
    ENDROUTINE
ENDMODULE
```

### Build Process

**Interactive build (verified on ND-100, PLANC Version E):**

```
@PLANC
PROG-FILE "HELLO"
COMPILE HELLO:PLNC,"HELLO:LIST","HELLO"
EXIT
@HELLO
```

**Automated build (MODE file):**

File: `DO-BUILD:MODE`

```mode
@DELETE-FILE HELLO:PROG
@DELETE-FILE HELLO:LIST
@DELETE-FILE HELLO:BRF
@PLANC
PROG-FILE "HELLO"
COMPILE HELLO:PLNC,"HELLO:LIST","HELLO"
EXIT
@HELLO
```

Run with: `@MODE DO-BUILD:MODE,,`

See also [BUILD-PLANC.MODE](../../Workflow/BUILD-PLANC.MODE) and [BUILD-PLANC-2BANK.MODE](../../Workflow/BUILD-PLANC-2BANK.MODE) for parameterized builds.

### Build Output

The compiler produces three files:
- `HELLO:PROG` -- executable program (run with `@HELLO`)
- `HELLO:BRF` -- binary relocatable file
- `HELLO:LIST` -- compiler listing with line numbers

### COMPILE Parameters

`COMPILE source, list, object`

1. `source` -- source file (exists, no quotes needed)
2. `list` -- listing output (created, needs `"quotes"`)
3. `object` -- object file name (created, needs `"quotes"`, produces :BRF)

**SINTRAN quoting rule**: files being CREATED need `"quotes"`. Existing files do not.

## PLANC Syntax Summary

- `MODULE`/`ENDMODULE` structure -- NOT Pascal's PROGRAM/BEGIN/END
- Entry point: `PROGRAM : name` inside the module
- `INISTACK` must be called first to initialize the runtime stack
- `OUTPUT(device, format, variable)` writes to terminal (device 1)
- `'AL17'` = Alphanumeric, Left-justified, 17 characters
- `'$'` in output strings = CR+LF (newline). Literal `$` = `$$`
- **The `'ALn'` count INCLUDES the trailing `$`** -- `'CHAT: bye$'` is TEN characters. The number is
  a FIELD WIDTH, not a maximum: too small silently cuts the line off, too large pads it. Nothing in
  the compiler checks it, so a wrong width builds clean and only shows up on screen. Leaving the
  width off entirely (`'AL'`) sizes the field automatically and is the safer habit for anything
  whose length is not fixed and counted
- **A string literal cannot be stored into an element of a `BYTES` array.** `' ' =: buf(i)` does not
  compile -- `'x'` is a STRING, `buf(i)` is a BYTE. The compiler answers
  `*** ERROR - ILLEGAL DATA TYPE "BUF"`, blaming the ARRAY, which sends you to a declaration where
  nothing is wrong. Hold the character in a one-element `BYTES` and copy element to element. The
  same idiom is needed in the other direction to PRINT one byte, since `'ALn'` formats a string and
  handing it a byte prints the byte's NUMBER
- **Subarrays pass part of a buffer and their bounds may be VARIABLES** -- `name(0:len-1)`. Without
  one, a routine taking `BYTES` receives the array's whole declared length, leftovers included
- **A NAME DECLARED NOWHERE STILL COMPILES.** Measured: a BOOLEAN stored to and tested in two
  routines, declared in neither and not at module level, gave **`0 DIAGNOSTICS`** -- and the program
  ran with it permanently set. The signature is a flag that will not change: printing it
  immediately after `FALSE =: x` showed `1`. When a variable ignores an assignment, check the
  DECLARATION before debugging the logic. `SINTRAN/XMSG/tools/planc-lint.py` flags this
- **Two `EXPORT`s that agree in their first SEVEN characters are ONE name to the linker.** Ten
  characters to the compiler, seven across an `EXPORT`/`IMPORT`. It does NOT report a duplicate --
  it resolves every import to whichever entry it met first, so calls land in the wrong routine and
  read arguments that were never passed. Clean compile, clean link, and `LIST-ENTRIES-UNDEFINED`
  **empty**, because nothing is undefined. There is no message anywhere. See R114
- **`MAXINDEX` works on an array PARAMETER, and on a SUBARRAY** -- measured on D100.
  `MAXINDEX(a, 1) + 1` is the real length of a `BYTES` parameter, so a routine can bound itself
  instead of believing a size its caller passed. Not available inside a `STANDARD` routine. See R115
- **PLANC checks no array bounds, and that reaches the TESTS too.** A clamp that bounds only one of
  several fields is not a clamp (R116), and a test that overflows an array still PASSES, because its
  assertions land on bytes that are in bounds (R117). Assert the TOTAL length against the buffer
  size -- that is the check that catches it
- **A BOOLEAN will not pass where an INTEGER is declared.** `len <= 256` is a BOOLEAN, not a 0 or a
  1; write a second routine rather than trying to convert. See R118
- `BYTES : name := 'string'` declares byte array with implicit length
- `%` starts a comment to end of line
- `&` at end of line continues statement on next line
- `;` separates multiple statements on one line
- Assignment: `expression =: variable` (NOT `:=`)
- Not-equal: `><` (NOT `!=` or `<>`)
- All SINTRAN text files require CRLF line endings and even parity (bit 7)

## Getting the program INTO the system

A `:PROG` file that runs when you type its name is the beginning, not the end. SINTRAN has two
places a finished program properly belongs, and which one depends on what the program is for:

| | Started by | Terminal | Copies in memory | Stopped by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ordinary `:PROG` | `@NAME` | the caller's | one per run | ESC -- awkward, and impossible while blocked in a monitor call |
| **RT program** | `@RT NAME`, or at boot | **none** | one, resident | **`@ABORT NAME`** |
| **reentrant subsystem** | `@NAME` | the caller's | **one, SHARED by every user** | ends with the invocation |

A **server** wants to be an RT program -- nobody is logged in as it, and it must outlive every
terminal session. A **tool people run** wants to be reentrant -- many users at once, each with
their own data, one copy of the code.

Both routes, with the vendor manuals' mistakes corrected against a real machine, are in
**[PLANC-RT-AND-REENTRANT-PROGRAMS.md](PLANC-RT-AND-REENTRANT-PROGRAMS.md)**.

## Key Features

1. **MODULE-based:** Programs structured as modules with EXPORT/IMPORT
2. **Strong Typing:** Type-safe development with records, sets, pointers
3. **SINTRAN Integration:** Full monitor call access via `MONITOR_CALL()` or the named `MONn`
   routines - see [PLANC-MONITOR-CALLS.md](PLANC-MONITOR-CALLS.md) for how to find a call's
   name/number and the library load order (`MON-CALL-1BANK` before `PLANC-1BANK`)
4. **Compiler:** `@PLANC` on ND-100, `@PLANC-500` on ND-500
5. **XMSG IPC:** Via COSMOS XMP library routines (MON 200B not directly available) - see
   [COSMOS-XMP-LIBRARY.md](COSMOS-XMP-LIBRARY.md) for the full library documentation
6. **Inline Assembly:** `$*` prefix for MAC assembler statements
