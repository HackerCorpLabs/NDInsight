octal: 325B
name: BATCHMODEECHO
short_names: []
description: Controls echo of input and output if the program is executed in a batch
  or mode job. The purpose is to allow the program to communicate with the terminal
  in mode jobs.
notes:
- The state set by this monitor call is reset when the next batch or mode job starts.
- This monitor call is mainly used by the JEC system.

  description: If the parameter is -1, the bit mark from the previous batch or mode
    job is returned in the A register.
