short_names: []
description: Sets the computer's clock (i.e. the current system time) forward or back.
  If the operator panel has a clock, it is also adjusted.

- The startup time for RT programs can be set by StartupTime. When the current system
  time is modified, the next startup times of periodic programs started by StartupTime
  are also affected. Other scheduling times are not affected.

parameters:
- name: Param1
