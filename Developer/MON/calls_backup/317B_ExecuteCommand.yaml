octal: 317B
name: ExecuteCommand
short_names: []
description: Executes a SINTRAN III command. Specify the command name and the parameters
  as a text string.
notes:
- An error message is output if an error occurs. The program does not terminate.
- Some commands may destroy your program. Commands which affect your program’s memory
  area should be used with care.
- Some commands have output, e.g. @LIST-FILES. This is displayed on the terminal.
- Use SuspendProgram to wait a second between two ExecuteCommands which depend on
  each other, e.g. CreateFile and OpenFile.
- It may be advisable to use @enable-escape before this call, to avoid having problems
  terminating some commands.
see_also:
- CallCommand
- SetCommandBuffer. CallCommand terminates the program if an error occurs
