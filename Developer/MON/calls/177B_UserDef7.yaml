description: 'User-defined monitor call. You can implement up to 8 monitor calls yourself. These are named
  UserDef0, UserDef1,... UserDef7. The short names are US0, US1,...US7. To do this you need good knowledge
  of SINTRAN III. See the SINTRAN III listing parts one and two.


  - Use the DMAC subsystem or the @LOOK-AT command to patch in the MAC instructions of your monitor call.
  Place the code in physical memory after the SINTRAN III symbol 7ENDC. You ought to do this from a mode
  file. The monitor call is lost in a warm start.

  - Use the SINTRAN-SERVICE-PROGRAM command DEFINE-USER-MONITOR-CALL to define the entry point of the
  monitor call.

  - There are other ways of implementing user-defined monitor calls.

  - Some monitor calls are no longer in use. You may use these for user-defined monitor calls.

  - If the subsystems TPS is installed, the user-defined monitor calls 170 to 175 may not be used.'
