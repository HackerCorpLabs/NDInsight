name: SegmentToPageTable
short_names:
- ENTSG
description: 'Enters a routine as a direct task or as a device driver, and "remembers" which segments
  have been entered (up to 24 segments). These are reentered at restart following a power failure. The
  routines are connected to the interrupt system. They are loaded with the RT LOADER or by DMAC.


  - The segment where the routine resides must be fixed in memory. See FixScattered.

  - The segments can be removed from the selected PIT by using function 4 of ChangeActiveSegments (MON
  341).

  - Unfixing the segment (using UnFixSegment, MON 116), removes it from the Page Index Table.'

parameters:
- name: SegmentNo
  type: INTEGER2
  io: I
  description: Segment number where the routine resides.
- name: PageTable
  type: INTEGER2
  io: I
  description: Page table to use for the segment. In practice, this should be 3. For SINTRAN III VSX,
    version K, the range is 0-17.
- name: InterruptLevel
  type: INTEGER2
  io: I
  description: The interrupt level where the direct task should run. You must specify one of the free
    levels 6, 7, 10B or 11B. Do not use level 2B on SINTRAN III VSX, version K.
- name: StartAddress
  type: INTEGER2
  io: I
  description: Start address of the routine (entry point).
