# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: SegmentToPageTable
# Octal: 157B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 157B
name: SegmentToPageTable
short_names: []
description: Enters a routine as a direct task or as a device driver, and "remembers"
  which segments have been entered (up to 24 segments). These are reentered at restart
  following a power failure. The routines are connected to the interrupt system. They
  are loaded with the RT LOADER or by DMAC.
notes:
- The segment where the routine resides must be fixed in memory. See FixScattered.
- The segments can be removed from the selected PIT by using function 4 of ChangeActiveSegments
  (MON 341).
- Unfixing the segment (using UnFixSegment, MON 116), removes it from the Page Index
  Table.
