short_names: []
description: Places a segment in physical memory. Its pages will no longer be swapped
  to the disk. The segment is placed in a contiguous area of physical memory. This
  function is useful for time-critical operations.
notes:
- The segment must be created with the RT LOADER as a non-demand segment.
- Use UnfixSegment or @UNFIX to allow the RT LOADER to clear the segment.
- Your program normally terminates if you refer to a nonexistent segment or a demand
  segment. An error message is output on the error device. See parameters 1 and 3
  to get a status value instead.
