octal: 167B
name: AttachSegment
short_names: []
description: Attaches a reentrant segment to your two current segments. The address
  areas of the segments may overlap. Pages in the reentrant segment may be accessed
  for reading, writing, or fetching instructions. When written to, a page loses its
  reentrancy. It is stored on one of your current overlapping segments.
notes:
- The segment is treated as reentrant only for the RT programs which have attached
  it.
- Parts of the reentrant segment may not be outside the address area of your current
  segments. OUTSIDE SEGMENT BOUNDS is output if these parts are written to.
