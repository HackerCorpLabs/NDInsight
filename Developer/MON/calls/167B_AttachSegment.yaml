octal: 167B
name: AttachSegment
short_names:
- REENT
description: Attaches a reentrant segment to your two current segments. The address areas of the segments may overlap. Pages in the reentrant segment may be accessed for reading, writing, or fetching instructions. When written to, a page loses its reentrancy. It is stored on one of your current overlapping segments.
notes:
- The segment is treated as reentrant only for the RT programs which have attached it.
- Parts of the reentrant segment may not be outside the address area of your current segments. OUTSIDE SEGMENT BOUNDS is output if these parts are written to.
