  See appendix A. The return status >=0 means the call terminated correctly. Parameters
  which do not affect the call format are called "dummy" below. All call formats contain
  logical unit number (0-3) in function code bits 6-8. Status=EXABS(logical device
  number, Unit/function code, dummy, dummy, dummy) The hardware status is returned
  as error code. The device must be reserved. Otherwise a positive error code may

  code, dummy, dummy, dummy) Status is Standard Error Code. Status=EXABS(logical device
  number, Unit/function code, physical memory address, sector address, no of sectors
  to read) Status=EXABS(logical device number, Unit/function code, physical memory
