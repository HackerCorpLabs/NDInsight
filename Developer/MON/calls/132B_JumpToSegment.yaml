# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: JumpToSegment
# Octal: 132B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 132B
name: JumpToSegment
short_names:
- MCALL
description: Calls a routine on another segment in the ND-100. You can divide an ND-100 RT program between
  various segments. This monitor call switches one or both of the current segments according to what you
  specify in parameter 2. ChangeSegment may be used instead of JumpToSegment and ExitFromSegment. The
  segment numbers are restricted to 8-bits (values 0-255). Use SegmentFunction (MON 341) with version
  K of SINTRAN III.
notes:
- Use ExitFromSegment to return from the routine.
- JumpToSegment may be nested.
- This monitor call does not change reentrant segments.

parameters:
- name: Param1
  type: UNKNOWN
  io: I
  description: Address of routine.
- name: Param2
  type: UNKNOWN
  io: I
  description: New segments. The most significant byte identifies the first segment. The least significant
    byte identifies the second segment. Use 377B as segment number if you do not want to change it. The
    RT description identifies the segments which are current.
