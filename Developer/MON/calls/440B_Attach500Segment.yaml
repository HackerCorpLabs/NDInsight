description: 'Maps a logical ND-500 data segment onto shared ND-100/ND-500(0) physical
  memory (multiport memory). Example: ``` @SINTRAN-SERVICE-PROGRAM *CHANGE-TABLE TABLE:
  MEMORY-AREA-INVISIBLE-FOR-THIS-SYSTEM FUNCTION: INSERT-ELEMENT IMAGE OR SAVE AREA
  (DEFAULT IS IMAGE)? IMAGE FIRST PAGE (OCT): 10000 LAST PAGE (OCT): 13777 FUNCTION:
  EXIT *EXIT ```


  - The specified physical memory area must be defined in the "Not initialize page"
  table by use of the *CHANGE-TABLE command in the SINTRAN Service Program (follow
  this command by a warm start to put the change into effect). Note that you should
  not use the first pages of the multiport memory (starting at "ND-500 page 0") for
  this.'
