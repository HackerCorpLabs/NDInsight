description: 'Operates the CAMAC, i.e. executes the NAF register. CAMAC is a standardized way to connect
  peripheral equipment to a computer. NAF data looks like this: ``` 15   13     9 8     5 4    0 -----------------------------
  |  Q  X  | STATION | SUBADDRESS | FUNCTION | ----------------------------- ``` If Q=1 and/or X=1, then
  Q and X responses from the station are automatically checked. A Control/Status register (COST register)
  holds some extra information. If the Function parameter is 3 (clear), the contents of COST are returned
  in the Value parameter. If Function=0 (read), data is returned in Value. For both these functions, parameter
  2 must be ≥0 on entry. If Function=1 (write) parameter 2 must be <0 before the call. If bit 15 in Crate
  Number is set to 1, Value is treated as an integer instead of floating point.'
