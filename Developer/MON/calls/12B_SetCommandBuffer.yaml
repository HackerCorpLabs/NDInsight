# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: SetCommandBuffer
# Octal: 12B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 12B
name: SetCommandBuffer
short_names: []
description: Transfers a string to the command buffer. The command buffer contains
  the last command input from the terminal. You may read the command buffer by reading
  from logical device number 0. See InByte.
notes:
- The command @TERMINAL-STATISTICS lists the command buffer.
- You may apply the SINTRAN III command editing characters to the command buffer when
  the program has terminated.
- The parameter is fetched through the alternative page table.
- You may use this monitor call to erase sensitive information in the command buffer,
  e.g., password parameters.
