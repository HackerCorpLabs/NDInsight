octal: 70B
name: CallCommand
short_names:
- COMMND
description: |-
  Executes a SINTRAN III command from a program. The program terminates if an error occurs in the command.

  - You are advised to use the newer monitor call, ExecuteCommand (UECOM), instead of CallCommand.
  - Some commands may destroy your program. Use care with commands which affect your program's memory area.
  - Note that the program may terminate if an error occurs. Use ExecuteCommand (UECOM) to avoid this problem.
  - For commands with output, but without an output file as a parameter, e.g. @WHO, output is displayed automatically on the terminal of the user executing the program.
  - Use SuspendProgram to wait a specified time interval between two CallCommands which depend on each other, e.g. CreateFile and OpenFile.
  - The following commands are allowed from ND-500 programs: @DATCL, @COPY, @COPY-FILE, @SCHEDULE, @HOLD, @TERMINAL-MODE, @OPERATOR, @WAIT-FOR-OPERATOR, @SET-TERMINAL-TYPE, @GET-TERMINAL-TYPE, @CREATE-FILE, @EXPAND-FILE, @DELETE-FILE, @RENAME-FILE, @LIST-FILE, @FILE-STATISTICS, @OPEN-FILE, @CONNECT-FILE, @SET-FILE-ACCESS, @CLOSE-FILE, @LIST-OPEN-FILE, @SET-BLOCK-SIZE, @SET-PERMANENT-OPEN, @SET-BYTE-POINTER, @SET-BLOCK-POINTER, @APPEND-SPOOLING-FILE, @DELETE-SPOOLING-FILE, @SET-TEMPORARY-FILE, and @SCRATCH-OPEN.
