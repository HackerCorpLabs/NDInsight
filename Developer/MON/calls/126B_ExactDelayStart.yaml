# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 126B
name: ExactDelayStart
short_names:
- DSET
description: |-
  Sets an RT program to start after a given period. It is then moved from the time queue to the execution queue. The period is specified in basic time units. A basic time unit is 1/50th of a second. The period may be from 1 to 4294967647 basic time units.

  - The program may already be in the time queue. It is then reinserted according to the new specifications.
  - A period less than or equal to 0 transfers the RT program to the execution queue the next time the basic time unit counter is incremented.
  - SetClock, AdjustClock and @CLADJ do not affect the interval.
