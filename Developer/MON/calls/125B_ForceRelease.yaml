# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: ForceRelease
# Octal: 125B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 125B
name: ForceRelease
short_names: []
description: 'Releases a device reserved by an RT program other than that which is
  calling. You can then reserve the device for your own RT program. Some devices,
  such as terminals, have both an input and output part. You can only release one
  part with each ForceRelease.


  - Use ReservationInfo to get the RT description address of the reserving RT program.
  You may then give the device back with ForceReserve.

  - Programs in a waiting queue may reserve the device between your ForceRelease and
  ReserveResource calls if they have higher priority than your program.

  - The SINTRAN III Real Time Guide (ND-860133) describes this in more detail.'
