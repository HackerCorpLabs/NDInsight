name: CopyPage
short_names:
- COPAG
description: 'Copies file pages between two opened files. One of the files may be
  a magnetic tape or floppy disk with volume.

  - This is a special monitor call used by the BACKUP-SYSTEM. No high-level language
  interface exists. The use of the X and D registers is tailored for reading labels
  on magnetic tape.

  - Copying stops at end-of-file, a non-existent page, or if a short magnetic tape
  record is found.

  - CopyPage is only used for sequential copying, i.e., a sequence of CopyPage calls
  must start with page number zero.

  - Files should be opened for random read or write.

  - Both files must be local files.'
