# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: STARTUPINTERVAL
# Octal: 103B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 103B
name: StartupInterval
short_names:
- INTV
description: Prepares an RT program for periodic execution. The interval between the executions can be specified in hours, minutes, seconds, and basic time units. A basic time unit is 1/50th of a second.
notes:
- The RT program is not started. Use StartRTProgram, @RT, or similar, to start it.
- StopRTProgram, Disconnect, @ABORT or @DSCNT cancel this monitor call.
- One execution may be unfinished when it is time for the next execution, in which case the program's restart flag is set. If the delay becomes as long as two intervals, one execution is lost.
- The interval replaces any earlier specified intervals.
- AdjustClock and @CLADJ do not affect the interval.
