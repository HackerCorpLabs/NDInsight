# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: ExactInterval
# Octal: 130B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 130B
name: ExactInterval
short_names:
- DINTV
description: |-
  Prepares an RT program for periodic execution. The interval between the executions may be from 1 to 4294967647 basic time units. A basic time unit is 1/50th of a second.

  - The RT program is not started. Use, for example, StartRTProgram or @RT to start it.
  - StopRTProgram, Disconnect, @ABORT or @DSCNT cancel this monitor call.
  - One execution may be unfinished when it is time for the next execution. In this case, the program's restart flag is set. If the delay becomes as long as two intervals, one execution is lost.
  - The interval replaces any earlier specified intervals.
  - AdjustClock and @CLADJ do not affect the interval.

- StartupInterval
- '@DINTV. StartupInterval allows you to specify intervals in seconds'
- minutes or hours
parameters:
- name: RTProgram
  type: INTEGER
  io: I
  description: Address of an RT description. 0 means calling program. GetRtAddress gives RT description addresses.
- name: BasicTimeUnits
  type: INTEGER
  io: I
  description: Period between executions in basic time units (1/50th second).
