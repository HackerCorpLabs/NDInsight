name: ExactInterval
short_names: []
description: 'Prepares an RT program for periodic execution. The interval between
  the executions may be from 1 to 4294967647 basic time units. A basic time unit is
  1/50th of a second.


  - The RT program is not started. Use, for example, StartRTProgram or @RT to start
  it.

  - StopRTProgram, Disconnect, @ABORT or @DSCNT cancel this monitor call.

  - One execution may be unfinished when it is time for the next execution. In this
  case, the program''s restart flag is set. If the delay becomes as long as two intervals,
  one execution is lost.

  - The interval replaces any earlier specified intervals.

  - AdjustClock and @CLADJ do not affect the interval.'
