# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: SuspendProgram
# Octal: 104B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 104B
name: SuspendProgram
short_names:
- HOLD
description: Suspends the execution of your program for a given time. The execution then continues after
  the time specified by the monitor call.
notes:
- No reserved files or devices are released.
- The execution continues immediately if the program has the restart flag set.
- You may use NoWaitSwitch. Then the program restarts when a break occurs.
- If a program has been rescheduled by the monitor call? SET (mon 101, DelayStart) or ABSET (mon 102,
  StartupTime), this rescheduling will be destroyed when you use SuspendProgram.
- The parameters should not contain zero.
- Number of time units to suspend the program.
- The type of time units. 1 = basic time units, i.e. 1/50th of a second, 2 = seconds, 3 = minutes, 4 =
  hours.
