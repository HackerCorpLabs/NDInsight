octal: 255B
name: PIOCFunction
short_names:
- PIOCM
description: PIOC is a programmable input and output processor primarily used in data communication to handle networks like X.25 and Ethernet. It is controlled via a monitor call from SINTRAN III. More details, functions, and examples are provided in the PIOC Software Guide (ND-860161). PIOC is based on an MC 68000 processor. A PLANC compiler is available for PIOC.
notes:
- See the PIOC Software Guide (ND-860161) for more details, functions, and examples.
- 'Function number (0-7). Stored in the ND-100 T-register: 0: Reserve the ND-100 side of a slot. 1: Release the ND-100 side of a slot. 2: Send information to a PIOC-process. 3: Read a message from a PIOC-process. 4: Load segment into PIOC memory. 5: Unload all segments from PIOC memory. 6: Start the PIOC. 7: Stop the PIOC.'
- 'Status code (octal): 1: Successful execution. 2: No answer from the PIOC ND-100 driver. -10: No privilege. This call may only be used by user SYSTEM, from an RT-program or from ring 2. -11: Function not allowed before the PIOC is started. -24: Illegal function code. -25: The slot is occupied by another process. -26: Illegal slot number. -27: Slot not reserved by you. -30: The mailbox is not empty so it cannot receive information. -31: The mailbox is empty. No message to fetch. -32: Illegal LDN. -33: The PIOC is not initiated. -34: The PIOC memory is not all fixed. 41: Space not available. 42: Illegal segment. 43: Segment not loaded. 44: Attempt to fix demand segment. 45: Attempt to fix too many pages. 46: Segment already fixed at different address.'
