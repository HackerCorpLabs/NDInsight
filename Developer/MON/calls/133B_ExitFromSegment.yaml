# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: ExitFromSegment
# Octal: 133B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 133B
name: ExitFromSegment
short_names: []
description: Exchanges one or both current segments. Commonly used to return after
  the monitor call JumpToSegment. ChangeSegment may be used instead of JumpToSegment
  and ExitFromSegment. The segment numbers are restricted to 8-bits (values 0-255).
  Use SegmentFunction (MON 341) with version K of SINTRAN III.
notes:
- The L register must contain the return address. This makes the monitor call complicated
  to use in high level languages.
