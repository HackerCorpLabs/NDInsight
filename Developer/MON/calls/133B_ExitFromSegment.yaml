# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: ExitFromSegment
# Octal: 133B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 133B
name: ExitFromSegment
short_names:
- MEXIT
description: Exchanges one or both current segments. Commonly used to return after the monitor call JumpToSegment.
  ChangeSegment may be used instead of JumpToSegment and ExitFromSegment. The segment numbers are restricted
  to 8-bits (values 0-255). Use SegmentFunction (MON 341) with version K of SINTRAN III.
notes:
- The L register must contain the return address. This makes the monitor call complicated to use in high
  level languages.
