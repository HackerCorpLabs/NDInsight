octal: 127B
name: ExactStartup
short_names: []
description: Starts an RT program at a specific time. The time is given in basic time
  units. A basic time unit is 1/50th of a second. The RT program is moved from the
  time queue to the execution queue at the specified time.
notes:
- It may already be later than the time specified. The RT program is then scheduled
  for the next day.
- The RT program may already be in the time queue. It is then reinserted according
  to the new time specifications.
- AdjustClock and @CLADJ affect the startup. The RT program starts according to the
  new time.
- Use GetBasicTime to read the internal time in basic time units.
see_also:
- StartupTime. StartupTime allows you to specify the time in hours
- minutes or seconds
