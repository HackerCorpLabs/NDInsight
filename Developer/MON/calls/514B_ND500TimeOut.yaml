# SINTRAN III Monitor Call: ND500TimeOut
# Octal: 514B
# Extracted from: Monitor Calls.md (ND-860228.2 EN)

octal: 514B
name: ND500TimeOut
short_names:
- 5TMOUT
description: |-
  Suspends the execution of an ND-500 program for a given time. The execution then continues after the monitor call. The program is placed in a time queue in the ND-500, not the ND-100.

  - No reserved files or devices are released.
  - Avoid using TimeOut (mon 267) from ND-500, use ND500TimeOut instead. Use TimeOut from ND-100.
see_also:
- TimeOut
- SuspendProgram
- WaitForRestart
parameters:
- name: Param1
  type: UNKNOWN
  io: I
  description: Number of time units to suspend the program. Use 0 to restart programs immediately. This
    clears the restart flag.
- name: Param2
  type: UNKNOWN
  io: I
  description: The type of time units. 1 = basic time units, i.e. 1/50th of a second, 2 = seconds, 3 =
    minutes, 4 = hours.
- name: Param3
  type: UNKNOWN
  io: I
  description: Restart cause. 0 means that the defined time has elapsed. 1 means that an interrupt occurred.
    -1 means that the RT program was scheduled for repeated execution.
