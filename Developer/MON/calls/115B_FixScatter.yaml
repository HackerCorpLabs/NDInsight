description: Place a segment in physical memory. Its pages will no longer be swapped
  to the disk. The segment must be non demand. Its pages will be scattered in physical
  memory. You may, for example, use this function for time critical operations or
  for allocating DMA buffers.
notes:
- Use UnFixSegment or @UNFIX to allow the RT LOADER to clear the segment.
- Your program terminates if you refer to a nonexistent segment or a demand segment.
  An error message is output on the error device.
